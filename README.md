# Restaurant Recommendation System

## Project Overview

This repository contains a Restaurant Recommendation System that helps users discover and select dining options based on various criteria and preferences. The system leverages data analysis and machine learning techniques to provide personalized restaurant recommendations.

## Features

- Intelligent restaurant suggestions based on user preferences
- Comprehensive filtering options
- Machine learning-powered recommendation algorithm
- User-friendly interface for exploring dining options

## Technology Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Machine Learning Libraries:** scikit-learn, pandas, numpy
- **Data Processing:** pandas
- **Visualization:** matplotlib, seaborn
- **Web Framework:** (Please specify, e.g., Flask, Django)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip package manager

### Setup Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/neekuujii2/Restaurant_recommened_system.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Restaurant_recommened_system
   ```

3. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Application

```bash
python main.py
```

### Configuration

Modify the `config.yaml` file to adjust recommendation parameters and settings.

## Data Sources

- Restaurant information from [specific sources, e.g., local databases, APIs]
- User reviews and ratings
- Geolocation data

## Machine Learning Model

The recommendation system employs  collaborative filtering, content-based filtering and hydrid model  to generate personalized suggestions.

### Key Recommendation Criteria

- Cuisine type
- User ratings
- Price range
- Location proximity
- Dietary preferences
