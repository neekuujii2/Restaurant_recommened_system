1,2023-09-16,2023-09-17,GRANVILLE,"Great ambiance indoors and attentive staff. Really great food. Right next to Cedars so lots of ambulance sirens, so eat inside if that bothers you. Be careful with the margarita. They must put ghost chili peppers in it because I couldn't feel my lips after one sip. Had to ditch it. But the Stroganoff and brownie dessert were terrific.","8701 Beverly Blvd West Hollywood, CA 90048",4.4,2672,"American (New), Cocktail Bars",$$

1,2023-09-06,2023-09-17,GRANVILLE,One of my absolute favorite places in WeHo for brunch. The atmosphere is sleek and inviting and the menu is humongous and varied.

1,2023-09-04,2023-09-17,GRANVILLE,"These five stars are for the food, service, and ambiance.First off, I love how this location allows reservations unlike the one in Pasadena.Secondly the customer service was off the chain. I know there are plenty of snooty customers here daily, I witnessed many while dining here. But that's not what we are here for lol our waitress Charis M and manager Celine were exceptional. This was the first time my friends and I dined here for brunch and we will definitely be coming back.From the drink recommendations to the food everything was delicious and tasteful,It was a group of six of us and we all enjoyed a variety of items on the menu. I will say the grilled cheese dipper and skirt steaks were highlights of the dishes,The cucumber martini was phenomenal , lemon drops were also delicious! Overall our experience here was a really good one thanks to Charis and Celine please continue to hire wonderful employees like these ladies!","8701 Beverly Blvd West Hollywood, CA 90048",4.4,2672,"American (New), Cocktail Bars",$$
1,2023-09-03,2023-09-17,GRANVILLE,"Visited Granville for a quick lunch and had an excellent experience. We were seated immediately, which was a nice surprise.Started off with the brussel sprouts and bread and butter--both were delicious and set a high expectation for the rest of the meal. For entrees, I had the El Gaucho salad with chicken, and my partner opted for the angel hair pasta. Both were satisfying and flavorful.We were so eager to dig in that we forgot to take photos, so I guess we'll just have to come back for round two! Overall, a solid four-star experience.","8701 Beverly Blvd West Hollywood, CA 90048",4.4,2672,"American (New), Cocktail Bars",$$

1,2023-08-31,2023-09-17,GRANVILLE,Food was fine. Follow up service was non existent. No one ever came by to take the dirty plates or refill drinks. We had to get up to ask twice for water refills - still never came. We left.,"8701 Beverly Blvd West Hollywood, CA 90048",4.4,2672,"American (New), Cocktail Bars",$$
1,2023-08-31,2023-09-17,GRANVILLE,"The food was fine and the ambiance was nice. Our server was the bartender and he was kind enough but a bit too busy to focus on our refills and checking in.I ordered the salad with add on veggie chicken. It came out to $23, which I would call very over priced for the portion size. The taste was good but it was a small salad and the $6 add on protein was super bland without much thought given to its preparation.My husband got the Caesar salad with an $8 salmon add on. He enjoyed it but, again, it was small.I don't think our waters were ever refilled.I can understand being busy but I probably wouldn't revisit simply because of the unwarranted high prices.","8701 Beverly Blvd West Hollywood, CA 90048",4.4,2672,"American (New), Cocktail Bars",$$
2,2023-09-16,2023-09-17,Running Goose,"Visited this restaurant based off of a recommendation on Instagram, and needless to say had a very mixed experience.First, the service was very good. The staff was very nice and helpful when describing the menu and some of the more popular items.Secondly, the food was delicious. My friends and I each enjoyed our plates as we ordered everything from the calamari to the chilaquiles and steak.  The short rib in the chilaquiles was super tender and flavorful and I could've eaten bowls of it the remainder of the day.The biggest issue we had while dining was simply the flies that were around due to a lot of the live plants from the environment of the restaurant. So that was a bit of a nuisance when dining and trying to fight off the gnats a little bit during the earlier hours of brunch.Unsure if that's a normal experience, but aside from that definitely recommend the cuisine here.","1620 N Cahuenga Blvd Los Angeles, CA 90028",4.3,1701,"Gastropubs, Latin American",$$
2,2023-09-16,2023-09-17,Running Goose,"Came here before pantages and what a unique find. You can tell the chef trying to be unique and trying to do things just a bit different.  The warmth and hospitality were wonderful. We ordered a variety of dishes Including Arugala tostada (tasted like a delicious avocado toast), corn tostada (ok), potatoes (yummy but could be crispier), pork belly (deliciously charred), beet quesadilla (wow...who would have guessed), baked Brie (oh my!), and the crème brûlée (very good). The only thing that disappointed me was the pavlova.  One of my ultimate favorite desserts.  I loved  the effort to be unique. It was a deconstructed pavlova with ice cream.  It seemed to be more ice cream than anything and The fruit was very tart. So one bite was  super sweet and the next was so tart my mouth and face literally puckered.  The back patio was quaint and a fun find tucked in Hollywood.  The owner was super sweet making sure everything was ok, telling us to walk to pantages bc parking was cheaper.  This felt much more like a European cafe  where you asked for a check and you can sit and talk to friends all night.  Or even going over to his house for a bbq.  We weren't rushed in anyway.  Would recommend trying.","1620 N Cahuenga Blvd Los Angeles, CA 90028",4.3,1701,"Gastropubs, Latin American",$$
2,2023-09-15,2023-09-17,Running Goose,We came with friends on a Sunday and just expected more. The dishes had subpar food flavor and was overpriced.,"1620 N Cahuenga Blvd Los Angeles, CA 90028",4.3,1701,"Gastropubs, Latin American",$$
2,2023-09-12,2023-09-17,Running Goose,Excellent food and service!  I've had 2 meals here.  All plates are meant to be shared.   This is the perfect place to go before a show at the Pantages.  It is within walking distance.,"1620 N Cahuenga Blvd Los Angeles, CA 90028",4.3,1701,"Gastropubs, Latin American",$$
2,2023-09-10,2023-09-17,Running Goose,"I can't say anything about the food because unfortunately, I didn't make it that far. We came in on a hot summer day and asked the owner/waiter if there was a fan or somewhere with a/c. His reaction was rude, apathetic, and snobby. If he would've answered empathetically we probably would have stayed, but the attitude definitely made us loose our appetite. I felt like he was doing a favor letting us sit at his restaurant. Everyone in the restaurant looked like they were sitting in a sauna. For a nice expensive meal, I don't want to drip all over the table and be talked down to, thank you.","1620 N Cahuenga Blvd Los Angeles, CA 90028",4.3,1701,"Gastropubs, Latin American",$$
2,2023-09-05,2023-09-17,Running Goose,"Phenomenal. Came for brunch and all the food was amazing. The benedict comes with ham not sliced ham, chunks of ham. I thought it was actually pork belly. So, so good. The brioche toast was like a dessert. The house-made lemonade is perfect: fresh lemon flavor and not too sweet. Service was great, and the outdoor seating area is great. If it were a hotter day, I could see it getting uncomfortably hot on the patio, and they could use some fans out there. Highly recommend for brunch!","1620 N Cahuenga Blvd Los Angeles, CA 90028",4.3,1701,"Gastropubs, Latin American",$$

2,2023-09-03,2023-09-17,Running Goose,Great little place in Hollywood.  The pictures of the Duck confit on yelp sold me and I had to try it.  So tasty and the purée was good as well.  Short rib was tasty.  Gambas was a first try for me.  Just the right amount of spice with the shrimp.  And last the Horchata crème brûlée ended the meal perfectly.   Would for sure go back and suggest this place to anyone going to the area.  Great family feel and the service was spot on.  Two thumbs up.,"1620 N Cahuenga Blvd Los Angeles, CA 90028",4.3,1701,"Gastropubs, Latin American",$$
2,2023-09-02,2023-09-17,Running Goose,"WOW!!!! THE FOOD IS UNIQUE AND DELICIOUS!!!! I went with my niece, we were both hungry, and ordered 2 corn tortillas, lamb chops, the farmers vegetable which was fried carrots and short ribs. Every single dish was Extraordinary in taste and texture. The best meal I can remember in a very long time, so different in taste. We were full and didn't have room for dessert, which also looked scrumptious!!!My only critique would be better curb appeal. When we walked in I thought maybe I'd made a mistake as the ambiance was lacking but the friendly staff and incredible food made that all a minor foot note. It wouldn't be costly to create an other worldly ambiance. Just some faux leaf trellis panels attached to the wooden 1/2 walls that are throughout and maybe some big ceramic pots and some kind of creative hanging animal art descending from the ceiling. Like hanging globe or wild birds from the ceiling. There's such a diverse culinary experience that creating an atmosphere that draws us in would make it all the more Stellar. But Stellar Running Goose is!!!!","1620 N Cahuenga Blvd Los Angeles, CA 90028",4.3,1701,"Gastropubs, Latin American",$$
3,2023-09-14,2023-09-17,Hangari Kalguksu,"Highly recommend! This is THE place for a filling bowl of knife cut noodles in Koreatown. Handmade noodles in broth with such depth in flavor, each slurp warms your soul and each bowl feels like a snug hug. Perfect after a long day at work! Also loved the barley rice appetizer, 3 types of kimchi, and tteokbokki (spicy rice cakes).

Portions are large so you can comfortably split with someone. Sometimes there's a wait, but you get seated relatively quickly and food is always served efficiently.

The food is just so delectable even though the price is a little bit much. But I believe the food and the service fits the price so that's why I'm giving it all the stars. The sauces and side dishes included gave the dishes a lot of flavor and we asked for extra bowls and stuff and the staff were very accommodating. Definitely coming back here again if I get the chance!","3470 W 6th St Ste 9&10 Los Angeles, CA 90020",4.4,2557,"Korean, Noodles",$$
3,2023-09-10,2023-09-17,Hangari Kalguksu,"We came early on a Sunday evening, and was able to beat the dinner rush with no wait. I really loved the open seating. The decor was pretty modern yet felt homey. I ordered the chicken kalguksu and was very surprised to see how big the portion was. I'd say it was very worth it at its price. The broth was light and easy to eat, while still being well seasoned. Definitely a super comforting meal. The sides were also really good as well. Service was swift but the attentiveness/care was a bit lacking. For starters, the menus were thrown onto the table as we were being seated. An alarming eyebrow raiser for sure.  It also took awhile for someone to take notice of us. Not a huge issue though. Otherwise, would give a 5/5. I'd come here again to try the bossam.","3470 W 6th St Ste 9&10 Los Angeles, CA 90020",4.4,2557,"Korean, Noodles",$$

3,2023-09-10,2023-09-17,Hangari Kalguksu,OMG!! Tasted like my grandma's homemade kalguksoo!! My grandmother really loved kalguksoo and I wish I brought her to this place. She would have loved it! The chicken kalguksoo broth was so rich and they give you a whole chicken! Their bossam was the best ever!!

3,2023-09-10,2023-09-17,Hangari Kalguksu,"I went with a friend and getting two things was way too much, we definitely should have split one thing. But, we didn't regret it because it was really nice to try multiple things. The sujebi and the noodles were both perfectly cooked and chewy, and both soups had deep flavor and were so good. Generous with the amount of clams and seafood too, which was nice! The ambiance definitely is more of a modern vibe than traditional Korean spots, and service is good but there can be pretty decent lines at peak lunch hours, maybe 30 minutes or more (it really depends). Overall, this place is so good and I love recommending it to others, but it has a good reputation anyway.","3470 W 6th St Ste 9&10 Los Angeles, CA 90020",4.4,2557,"Korean, Noodles",$$

3,2023-09-05,2023-09-17,Hangari Kalguksu,"One of the best spots in K-town -- I used to frequent this place once a week until the prices went through the roof circa COVID-19.If you haven't tried the hand cut noodles in their Kalguksu, you're missing out - opt for the clam based stew instead of the chicken.5/5 easily.","3470 W 6th St Ste 9&10 Los Angeles, CA 90020",4.4,2557,"Korean, Noodles",$$

The ambiance was very chill and relaxed and I loved the indoor and outdoor option that they give you here. I will say I was obsessed with the pizza that we ordered. The prices were a bit more then I would have wanted to spend on a pizza but that's okay, its worth it for a special occasion.

We ordered Traditional breakfast, Maine lobster omelette, avocado toast, kimchi fried rice and half baguette.  Everything we had was exceeded our expectations.  Huge thick cut of bacon in traditional breakfast.  Lobster omelette was luxurious and delicious. Avocado toast was too pretty to cut into. Kimchi Fried rice was so tasty when you mix the two sunny side up eggs in.  Baguette with butter and jam brings back memories of Paris!Service was great.  They fill the water, check on you even though the restaurant was busy.Very relaxing atmosphere.  Beautiful place.  You order your food at the counter and prepay.  Then find a table and they will bring the food to your table.  There was a line but moving.  We waited in line for about 20 minutes.  Parking was a bit hard.  The area has some meter parking or free parking but very limited spaces.  Restaurant has valet parking but I didn't see the person.","624 S La Brea Ave Los Angeles, CA 90036",4.2,7038,"French, Breakfast & Brunch, Cocktail Bars",$$

I came by on a Friday night and place was busy but generally 1-2 tables open so we were able to get seated quickly.The pork belly and octopus is a satisfying dish that's well cooked with covered with a gouchujang sauce laid on top of onion. Goes well with a drink and a side of rice (they only have purple rice here). The seafood pancake was fantastic - good fillings and the batter was seasoned well and I loved the crumbly flaky texture on the outside.Service was solid.

The mackerel was cooked well but a bit plain - I didn't want to get anything too crazy or spicy since my friend and I were sharing. The decor is lovely, it was packed full of Korean families. Service was timely and efficient. Wish I could eat here one more time while I still live in Ktown, but I'll have to make a drive and fight for parking next time.

Their tenderness and exquisite flavor were nothing short of incredible. As for my girlfriend, she opted for the raw spicy marinated crab.

6,2023-08-25,2023-09-17,HanEuem,"Visited for a late lunch and had a mixed experience with both the food and service. Our order included the spicy raw crab, braised beef short ribs with cheese, and beer.Starting with the positives, the banchan assortment was delightful. I particularly enjoyed the spicy raw crab, although it was a touch too sauced. It paired well with rice. However, the braised beef short ribs left me disappointed.The first piece I picked up was a rice cake. Just before taking a bite, I noticed a faint sour smell. Despite that, I proceeded, finding the taste alright. Eventually, I realized the odor originated from the melted cheese topping. Unfortunately, the cheese had gone bad, casting a negative shadow over the dish and affecting my overall meal experience.Though the staff was friendly, their lack of attentiveness was noticeable. There was no check-in during the meal, despite our wish for banchan refills, water, and an additional beer. We even had to signal for assistance to order more rice, which should ideally be a standard accompaniment. Additionally, the rice served was dense and lacked fluffiness, further diminishing the experience.It would have been appreciated if the staff inquired about our meal satisfaction, but they were rather quick to present the bill and depart. Hoping for a more well-rounded experience next time.","539 S Western Ave Los Angeles, CA 90020",4.4,233,"Korean, Comfort Food, Gastropubs",

My friend and I were obsessed with the banchan here and ate all of our banchan with nothing left over.

It's worth noting that this isn't the kind of place where you can leisurely enjoy a meal for over an hour; it's more of a high-energy spot.As for parking, street parking can be a challenge, so it's a great suggestion to utilize the nearby garage across the street for a hassle-free experience.","801 S La Brea Los Angeles, CA 90036",4.3,653,"Italian, Cocktail Bars",$$

You can't go wrong with their pastas, they are always incredible. But I tried their tuna sandwich for the first time last night and just.... Wow. Hands down the best tuna sandwich I've ever had, which is saying something since I was already a huge fan of the basic tuna sandwich. The egg, cucumbers, and dill dressing blend beautifully together and bring out the tuna's flavor perfectly. The bread is exactly what you'd want on it too, sliced + toasted with just the right amount of butter. You can tell the chef behind their recipe was out to make the best tuna sandwich and you can taste the love behind it. So worth the 16 bucks! (And it comes with a side)Never have had a bad drink here. Their wine is great, but I get tipsy from wine easily and I'm often the designated driver, so I usually go with their pear cider Stem (and it's so good).As for desserts, I've tried their tiramisu some time back and wasn't a fan. Might've just been a bad night cause it just was on the bland and dry side. But they've since added cannolis, which are very good! I love their affogato as well.Price wise, it's about typical as any date night place in LA. Pastas are around 20 dollars, with it costing more to add protein. Apps remain around 10-15 depending on what you get. But you are paying for quality and won't be disappointed.Parking can be tricky. I usually go to one of the public parking lots a couple blocks down 8th street that's a dollar an hour. The garages right on La Brea can be quite expensive.","801 S La Brea Los Angeles, CA 90036",4.3,653,"Italian, Cocktail Bars",$$

We debated the set meant for 2-3 people, but we really wanted the hagfish ($42.99). The price difference between the two sets was about $30 so it made more sense to just go for the Master set (meant for 3-4 people).Staff were attentive and did all of the cooking for us. They'll cut the hinges on the big clams and cut the other pieces of seafood into tiny bits for you.

Every felt and looked really clean in the inside and it has a very chill drinking type of atmosphere. Our table sat outside and i must say I do prefer that. It felt like a scene out of a Korean drama. We got the grilled eel (it was good but wish it had some type of flavoring), and the chief set. There was 4 of us and I must say we did all get pretty full. One of my favorite has to be their spicy cold noodles. Insane how much flavor was in it I could eat atleast three!

It's not overwhelmingly noisy, though. Now, onto the food - I tried the ""Tremendous Burger ($20)"" which, to be honest, tasted only slightly better than a McDonald's burger. It didn't come close to the tastiness of In-N-Out. The sweet potato fries were decent but nothing to write home about.I also ordered a coffee for $7, and it was a pretty basic shaken latte, nothing exciting. When it comes to service, be prepared to wait at least 10 minutes for someone to take your order, and make sure to tell them everything you need all at once because who knows when you'll see them again.All in all, I'd rate the food 5/10. As for the overall experience, I have to stick with a 5/10, maybe a generous 6/10 if I had to be nice.

The regular price is $13 -- still way cheaper than the $17 or $18 bottles of soju I see at most places in Koreatown proper. The  waiter was so nice and offered my friend two free bottles of soju when we told him we're celebrating his birthday. The food was great and very affordable compared to Koreatown. The vibes were also amazing -- it gave a cozy forest aesthetic. Best of all, since it is on the fringe of Koreatown, there is plenty of free street parking.

Loved them both! The grain bowl had a bit of everything and felt pretty light and healthy. We split the waffle for dessert and it was perfectly sweet and satisfying. Also tried a lovely lavender latte.I think my only complaint is that the tables outside are kind of close together so it can be a little awkward but perhaps the tables inside are better spaces.Parking was easy to find in the residential streets and it was free for two hours.,"759 S La Brea Ave Los Angeles, CA 90036",4.4,2484,"Cafes, Breakfast & Brunch, American (New)",$$

12,2023-09-13,2023-09-17,Ka'teen,"Came here for my birthday since it's within walking distance from Bar Lis... I've tried TAO before but wanted to see what else was in the area.FLAVOR (4.5/5):1. 1/2 DOZEN OYSTERS: Yummy and fresh. Would definitely order again, but hard to share with 4 people. Maybe I should have gotten more...2. PAPAS BRAVAS: The potatoes were whole and super delicious. Really soft inside and flavor wise it hit the spot. I've found that you can never really go wrong with ordering Papas Bravas.3. PESCADO ZARANDEADO: The whole fish was yummy and came with 2 sauces. In my opinion, the sauces are a must! For both the entrees (this and the Cochinita Pibil) they come with tortillas so you can make your own taco. I thought this part of the experience elevated the food and allows you to adjust the dish to your own liking. I didn't like the whole fish as much as the Cochinita Pibil in terms of flavor. As far as whole fish goes, the sauces are what made this dish unique, but I preferred Zinqué's and Bavel's whole fish better.4. COCHINITA PIBIL: This was a flavor explosion! The meat was so tender it just fell apart and honestly it didn't need anything else - it was perfect with the pickled vegetables all rolled up in a tortilla. The highlight of the night.5. CHURROS: The churros were just okay; I wasn't in love with them in the same way as the Cochinita Pibil.SERVICE (5/5):Service was good!AMBIENCE (5/5):Beautiful atmosphere, perfect for date night or if you just want to have a nice night out. Somewhat of a jungle vibe with lots of plants and fans (lots of fans!) blowing breezes in every which direction. They had someone come by doing fire performances, which definitely elevated the ambience.TAKEAWAYS:I would definitely come back to try more of their menu - if everything is on the same level as the Cochinita Pibil then Ka'teen really tops the ranking in terms of restaurants in the area. Honestly, for ambience alone Ka'teen is worth a visit.","6516 Selma Ave Los Angeles, CA 90028",4.0,577,"Mexican, Cocktail Bars, Breakfast & Brunch",

I would recommend coming here with a large group so you can get the chance to try more dishes.. and the ambience is unbeatable, especially on a warm summer night.

Great food, drinks, and entertainment.Our server Monique was attentive, patient and very informative about each dish as this was our first time there.I'm only giving four stars because I do believe it is overpriced :( but I'm starting to see that as a trend here in LA. For a party of 6 the bill was over $800 w/ gratuity, taxes and their HLA fee. We all had about one drink each, our own dish and shared 2 appetizers so I thought this was a bit pricey.I would love to come back during the day time and grab brunch.","6516 Selma Ave Los Angeles, CA 90028",4.0,577,"Mexican, Cocktail Bars, Breakfast & Brunch",
12,2023-09-10,2023-09-17,Ka'teen,"I agree with other reviewers that the prices for the food and drinks here are pretty extravagant. My husband and I wanted to try KA'TEEN out as part of our celebration for our one year wedding anniversary. We ordered the ceviche, the short rib, and the yucca fries as well as the pana cotta for dessert. Short rib and yuca were delicious, so we didn't mind paying the prices for that. Our ceviche was pretty much all small pieces of mango. We maybe had 10 small cubes of fish. For 24 dollars I would definitely pass. Small drinks at 20 bucks a piece...I know it's Hollywood but it's pretty steep. The panna cotta was supposed to be tres leches inspired but it literally just tasted like yogurt. Like a lot of reviewers said, you are paying for the ambience. It is pretty, however our table was a little weird the way one of us was sitting really high up and the other very low across the table. Check your bill too, because they had charged us a six dollar ""champagne greet"" which maybe was supposed to be for our anniversary, but I guess the server forgot. Then they also add 5 percent for employee healthcare charge...just a heads up. We won't return, but it was fun to try out. Our fav restaurants in LA are Michelin stared with epic views, dishes, ambiance, and impeccable service. They don't charge for champagne greetings for special occasions and they actually remember to do it! And what's hard to believe is they aren't near this expensive...We'll be sticking to our tried and trues for special occasions.","6516 Selma Ave Los Angeles, CA 90028",4.0,577,"Mexican, Cocktail Bars, Breakfast & Brunch",

It's 150 per person and basically the chef just picks out the dishes from the menu a la carte, which is like 4 items.So you lose the opportunity to pick which items you want from menu AND it's upcharged.I could have ordered those 4 items at HALF the cost. I feel very tricked.The wagyu tasted like regular steak that I could have made at home. Very dissapointed.","8450 W 3rd St Los Angeles, CA 90048",3.8,3109,"Cocktail Bars, Mexican, Steakhouses",$$$
15,2023-09-15,2023-09-17,Toca Madera - Los Angeles,"My husband and I have now been to all 3 locations (Scottsdale, Las Vegas, LA) and the LA one is the WORST. We attended 9/15/23. The server changed his attitude real quick when my husband and I said we were not ordering alcohol. He ignored us while we ate, forgot to give us the check at the end and it was obvious he prioritized tables that ordered alcohol. We ordered the $225.00 tomahawk steak medium rare and it came out blue. Barely warm. We sent it back to be cooked more, and it came out 15 minutes later well done. Don't order the shishito peppers. They're $16.00 for a hot, soggy bite of seeds. The ambiance is the same in all three restaurants as far as dim lighting, borderline obnoxious music and too many plants per square foot but on top of that, LA location is packed with tables, dying plants and staff at evert corner that is doing everything except smiling and moving to the right when you're trying to pass them. Guests should have the right of way. The nicest person about the experience was the bouncer. And the valet guys were nice and doing their jobs efficiently. The Scottsdale location is by far the best and the only one we will be recommending and returning to.","8450 W 3rd St Los Angeles, CA 90048",3.8,3109,"Cocktail Bars, Mexican, Steakhouses",$$$

The ambiance and decor are really feminine and pretty, the ambiance is super approachable, and the food is fantastic (I personally love the pizzas)! It's hard to find vegetarian options that actually TASTE good, but Olivia somehow achieves this. They apparently get all of their produce from local farmer's markets, so you know that you are eating super high quality and fresh ingredients. And on top of all this, the staff is so wonderful.

16,2023-08-30,2023-09-17,Olivia,"Disclaimer: Before I get into more details about Olivia, a thing to note is this place does not have traditional waiters/waitresses taking your orders and instead utilizes an online ordering service where you can order at your own pace and charge within the same group/table. The system works like at the bar where you have an open tab and when you're done ordering, you can close it and pay directly through the phone. If you aren't as technologically savvy, the staff is friendly and accommodating too!I booked a reservation for my girlfriend and me for a cute little anniversary dinner on a Sunday and the vibes were on point from the get-go. Our waitress greeted and congratulated us on our anniversary. She was very thorough when it came to describing how to use the ordering system and any recommended dishes. All of the staff were very lively, accommodating, and really friendly to the point where I felt like I was revisiting some old friends again.For the food, we ordered fried olives, crispy chicken, mushroom pate, housemade focaccia, and mushroom soy sausage pizza.-Fried Olives is really good and what everyone says about it is true. I am not a person who enjoys olives but this was a positive flavor surprise. GET IT!- Crispy Chicken is fried mushrooms and the seasoning gives them a similar nostalgia to eating KFC popcorn fried chicken. I loved it, especially with the pickled onions on the side and the dipping sauce it came with.- The mushroom soy sausage pizza was great, especially with the vegan, melty cheese topped with arugula for a peppery finish. We initially weren't able to order pizza since the waitress notified us there were some complications with the dough, thus pizzas were not available to order via the online ordering system. However, the problem seemed to be resolved and the waitress told us that the pizza may look a bit smaller due to the dough, but still the same portion used daily.-Lastly, we were surprised at the end with a complimentary olive oil cake with a dark, cherry sauce and topped with vanilla ice cream. The cake was subtly sweet, not dry, and tasted bright combined with the cherry and ice cream.Overall, we came as guests and left as family members. Everyone there was so nice and attentive. There was especially one of the waitresses who also checked up on us multiple times at the end, got to know us through some small talk, and brought good vibes in an endearing auntie way. Not only that, the music was exactly my type of jam. I love this place for its ambiance, friendly staff, and for having the best vibes. I'll definitely be back soon whenever I'm in LA.","205 S Vermont Ave Los Angeles, CA 90004",4.9,173,"Vegetarian, Pizza, Wine Bars",$$

It looks s a smaller place, they do take walk ins but I'd probably make a reservation just in case. The inside is very charming and has nice decor. The wait staff was very friendly and helpful. We started with the fried olives which were absolutely incredible. Such a great mixture of the saltiness of the fried olive, the creaminess of the ricotta and sweetness of honey. You can also make this dish vegan by substituting the honey for agave. Next we had the mushroom soy sausage pizza. All I can say is omg!!! It was so good. The crust was perfect, light and crispy without being burnt. It was to die for. I have been looking for a good pizza and this place delivered!!Another bonus, there is a parking lot which wasn't packed and didn't require valet like alot of places in K town.I would highly recommend this restaurant!!!","205 S Vermont Ave Los Angeles, CA 90004",4.9,173,"Vegetarian, Pizza, Wine Bars",$$

17,2023-08-14,2023-09-17,Osteria Mamma,"** First time trying Osteria Mamma **Wine menu is extensive and impressive!!We also made a reservation on a Saturday FOR Saturday.Parking was a breeze - found a spot right in front of the restaurant and so did our pals meeting us.Everyone is talking about the complementary bread... I feel like the idea of the complementary bread is wonderful but the bread itself isn't great. What is great is if your dining pal is ordering something with pink sauce... and then you can save the bread for the pink sauce but other than that, the bread is a big MEH and could totally step it up.Our waiter was from Italy - we thought this was wonderful! However... he interrupted my wife a few times and was actually kind of rude to her. Wasn't the coolest thing I experienced... he was attentive to our party but the rudeness was a little off-putting.The prices for the dish are very high considering the portions are on the smaller side. I had the salmon... it was cooked perfect but I felt like when I read the menu I was receiving something on the side vs just a tomato salad. For some reason, I interpreted this as a salmon with a tomato salad and a spinach salad. Turns out there were pieces of the spinach on top of the salmon - but it wasn't phrased as a sauce/or that it would be a salmon flavor addition.As I looked around, it seemed everyone's portion was small... which is fine (I suppose even more fine for fine dining) but for the prices, it just didn't seem worth it. I think my wife had like 20 small gnocchi's... my pal had 5 ravioli's and the lasagna was just TOO CHEESY.It was a bit warm inside the restaurant - and they have these lamps on the tables instead of lighting the restaurant with the restaurant's lighting. I feel like the lamps got in the way and some tables had cool lighting... some had warm lighting... it was an odd touch.Bathrooms need an update - the decor looks very out of place and there was a Christmas decoration. Why? No clue.I enjoyed the food - the tastes were delicious but for overall experience I am really a 3 star teetering a 4 star. We were all hungry after! And for a salmon for $38, I really didn't anticipate being hungry after but I am glad to have found a new restaurant... that is always the highlight.","5732 Melrose Ave Los Angeles, CA 90038",4.0,1916,"Italian, Wine Bars",$$
17,2023-08-14,2023-09-17,Osteria Mamma,"This is hands down one of the best Italian restaurants in Los Angeles. I have been dining here for 15 years now. The decor is simple and understated with generational photos of the family that run the restaurant. Ask your server to point out who is who and hear the history of this incredible, hard working family. Chances are the young ones in the photos have grown up and taken a role in the operation of this family gem.On to the food...The menu has grown over the years adding dishes that are a bit more contemporary while also keeping the original items too. For starters they recently added an Arancini dish loaded with saffron infused arborio rice and short rib. It is super crispy on the outside and beautifully decadent on the inside. The dish is accompanied by three incredible sauces to soak up. Additionally I have always loved their Frittura Mista and the Polipozzo to start with. The salads are beautiful and fresh and delicious.The Pasta is on another level here. All of these dishes will make you feel like the namesake Momma still prepares them herself, may she RIP. My favorite is the Tonnarelli alla Carbonara, the sauce is thick and creamy yet delicate and the guanciale is cooked to a crispness that just makes it pop in your mouth. Another favorite is the Bigolo all'Amatriciana, the pasta is thick and filled with a beautiful texture and the guanciale is mouth watering in the san marzano tomatoes it is cooked down with.For mains we have always enjoyed the Bisteconna and the Il Branza, both of which always come out perfectly cooked and leaving us wanting more, which is hard because these dishes are large and worth sharing.Now I am no wine aficionado, however the wine menu is incredible. They feature mainly Italian wines with a BOOK that gives the region the grapes were grown and define's each areas practices and tastes. It's a history lesson of wine really. Do not let this intimidate you. The servers know each wine almost by heart and can tell you, based on your likes or dislikes, which will best suit you. They are currently offering a $20 wine flight that is unbeatable. Do not pass on it!I truly love this place so much and am so happy this family has kept their Momma's traditions alive. It brings me so much happiness just stepping into this place.","5732 Melrose Ave Los Angeles, CA 90038",4.0,1916,"Italian, Wine Bars",$$

18,2023-09-10,2023-09-17,Beauty & Essex,"My husband and I had a reservation Saturday evening. We arrived at 5:45pm and we were seated at 6pm in the upstairs dining room to the right. We were the first party to be sat there. The ambiance was nice, darkly lit and romantic. Very LA fine dining vibe. More parties were seated in this dining room section and the noise definitely picked up, it was hard to hear yourself talk.Honestly, I was ready to give this restaurant 1 star and leave before ordering our food. We waited almost 25 minutes for someone to take our order. We watched 4 parties who came after us get their orders taken AND we watched them get their drinks and food delivered to their table. Not sure if they were under staffed tonight, but this was very frustrating since we had to make our showtime for the Pantages and I was worried if our food would come out in time. We made eye contact with two staff who would circle around the dining room, but they seemingly were just in charge of refilling water.My husband talked me down and finally, our waiter approached our table. My husband politely informed him that we have been waiting for a while to place our order and would have to leave soon to catch our show. Our waiter kindly apologized and he did do his best to remedy the situation.As soon as we put in our orders, I got up to use the bathroom and by the time I got back, all the food was already there on our table. They even gave us an extra complimentary dish of meatballs. This gesture and the swiftness of getting our food quickly to us was very much appreciated.We ordered:- Braised chicken meatballs 5/5: juicy, tender meat and strong flavor with creamy truffle sauce- Classic Thick Cut Filet 4.5/5: the steak on its own was very flavorful and came out perfectly medium rare, sauces were just okay- Baguette with garlic chive butter 3.75/5: bread was warm and soft with a crunchy crust; butter was creamy and easy to spread, but the taste kind of reminded me of AMC popcorn butter which isn't a bad thing- Mac and cheese with shrimp and lobster 2/5: Al dente pasta, saucy had a nice creamy consistency but there was absolutely no flavor to it; the only flavor came from the lobsterWe also ordered drinks. The Beauty Elixir was just okay, it tasted just like a glass of champagne but with a frothy consistency from the strawberry and cucumber pulp yet no hint of the fruits' flavor. My husband liked his drink though the Spicy Crush.Overall, I strongly give this restaurant 3 stars. The food borders between decent and good. I don't think it's worth its very expensive price point to warrant a second visit. Our server was kind and tried his best to make up for our situation. I just really wish the restaurant would have a better system of attending to guests once they are seated in the order they arrive.","1615 Cahuenga Blvd Los Angeles, CA 90028",4.2,1627,"Lounges, American (New)",$$$

Of course the cocktail prices have increased drastically after pandemic. Champagne prices were not bad to my surprise. They offer impressive gluten free and vegan menus. We really liked the eclectic dishes with an Asian fusion twist.The patio seating was very relaxing and spacious with beautiful potted plants. It was jazz Sunday but the entire restaurant was kind of empty. They didn't even need to open the upstairs dining area. For food we decided on fresh oysters, Thai shrimp, Branzino, filet mignon and broccolini. The food tasted fantastic and so flavorful. The portions were on the bigger side. We loved the dessert wheel in the end and it was fun to try them all. Our drinks were very well made and tasty too. We really enjoyed our dinner with jazz music in the background. It was a lovely evening for hubby and I. Our server was so friendly and attentive, in fact all staff were very welcoming and pleasant.I was glad that Beauty & Essex didn't disappoint, Tao group is really up to their game!

Something felt like it was missing though, nevertheless I ate all of it. If you are celebrating a birthday or an occasion and looking to have fun while sipping cocktails and want to share some bites with your friends and/or family you'll have fun here. Can get a bit loud but it's because everyone is laughing and enjoying the great music in the background. Parking is tricky but they have valet in the back of restaurant.

20,2023-09-12,2023-09-17,BROKEN MOUTH | Lee's Homestyle,"My partner and I decided to come here after browsing through highly rated restaurants on Yelp and it did NOT disappoint. If anything, I have now left with one of my new favorite places to eat in DTLA! Tim, the owner of Broken Mouth, was the person to take our order, and he was so incredibly kind and friendly! His hospitality alone is an 11/10. We ended up ordering a beef plate and a shrimp plate. We were also given a SPAM musubi and our drinks on the house as it was our first time! It wasn't busy when we came in the late afternoon so we waited roughly 10 minutes for our food. When our food got called out and we unpacked it at our table, we were speechless it all looked so amazing. Not only did it look amazing, it tasted so incredibly wonderful. The shrimp on my palate were nearly as big as my fist and were bursting with flavor. The beef on my partners plate was so tender and flavorful as well! Also, the greens come so well seasoned and the purple rice is perfectly cooked! I would certainly re-order both plates! The complimentary SPAM musubi was also so grand; I will definitely add it to my next order! Overall, if you are in the DTLA area, I highly recommend Broken Mouth. The service, food, and overall quality is worth every penny. The owner, Tim, mentioned he has dreams/goals of opening a sit-down restaurant. Please support this business so he can get there! You will not regret this dining experience!","718 S Los Angeles St Los Angeles, CA 90014",4.8,1656,"Hawaiian, Korean, Comfort Food",$$

It's quite peaceful yet lively here despite being in the center of LA. The service we got from Tim (the owner) was amazing! He's one of the kindest and most passionate owners I've met. He went through his entire menu with us, which made figuring out what to get a breeze! I got the beef plate and my fiancée got the shrimp plate, along with spam musubi, and two soft drinks. The food was DELICIOUS! We'll definitely be coming back again not just for the food, but Tim's welcoming and exceptional service. This is a MUST TRY if you're in LA.

The chicken was cooked great with a nice char. Perfect with the rice and saladBeef - 3/5 my biggest complaint is there's is not enough beef in the dish. I honestly was confused at first because I could not figure out where the beef was as all I could find was the egg batter.

CUCUMBER SALAD: The cucumber salad was a nice break from the dumplings, but it wasn't anything special3. HUI TOU (Beef): This was good! Crispy and yummy. Very filling4. VEGETARIAN PANCAKES: These were also good!5. XIAO LONG BAO: Not the best xiao long bao I've ever had, but yummy. At this point I was starting to get dumpling'd out and everything blurred together.6. THREE FLAVORED DUMPLINGS: I'm not a huge fan of surf and turf and I would probably skip this one next time, but that's just personal preference.7. SPICY PORK WONTON: We had to try this one since all the reviews talked about the Spicy Pork Wonton! It was also yummy, but I think I prefer Little Fatty's wontons.SERVICE (5/5):Service was good!AMBIENCE (4/5):Nice atmosphere - for a while they were playing 2000s emo music then switched to R&B once it got later into the night. Good for casual dinner or date night.PARKING (1/5):Street parking is atrocious. During a weekday you can find parking but all of it is paid. I imagine on weekends it's worse.TAKEAWAYS:I liked Hui Xou Tiang and it's nice to have a spot specifically for dumplings!

Spicy dumplings taste average, beef hui tou was too dense and meaty.Lamb skewers were ridiculously tender, delish, not gamey at all.

A little bit on the spicy side with their house chili oil which makes it even better! Food always comes fairly quick, and there's never a wait when I do go. It's small but comfortable inside, there's also a full bar! I also recommend trying their teas, it comes in a glass teapot that's perfect to share with your party. Parking is a bit limited since it is in Hollywood so definitely be prepared to park on the street.

We ordered three different types of dumplings, the hui tou and xiao long bao being our favorites. Everything was very good, but I wasn't super wowed by anything (except the hui tou!).

I wouldn't get this again. It doesn't have any unique flavor to it. I could replicate this by chopping some cucumbers at home.SESAME NOODLES: wish I would've read other reviews about these noodles.

My understanding is that their dinner is even more extravagant, but given the limitations of our travel plans, had to settle for lunch. Overall, it was delicious.

Both the waitress and the owner were very transparent about the composition of the dishes and where ingredients were sourced.For the food, we decided to share the koji butter steak and supplement the meal with more small plates (just make sure that if you want to order the steak, order it first to allot the chef at least 30 min to prepare it). We ordered the Hamachi Crudo, the scallops, and the stuffed chicken wings. The Hamachi crudo was super fresh and the quality of the fish was amazing. The stuffed chicken wings were also pretty good, but I think the next time I come here I'll try something different. On the other hand, the SCALLOPS, were delicious. I grew up vegetarian, and in the past few years, I've never quite warmed up to shellfish, scallops were something I've tried, but never liked. These scallops ended up being so delicious my partner and I ordered a second serving, and the chef was kind enough to add another scallop to our portion! The steak ended up being incredible, but the second most impressive thing was the coal-roasted Korean sweet potato side with some kind of Kimchi sauce. I would eat an entire plate of that, and my partner, who doesn't normally enjoy goguma, would 100% agree.Overall, Hibi was really great and it's been a while since I've had the chance to just sit down and enjoy nice Japanese/Korean food.

We could tell it had opened recently as we saw the good luck plants standing out at the entrance.We ordered the bossam + spicy jokbal combo as well as the Gamja tang.First the bossam:It was very well cooked. The browning seemed to stand out more here. The morsels were tender and perfectly cooked-I could almost feel the collagen plumping up my skin. The spicy jokbal was a new dish for us. I've had the non spicy kind. We ordered the medium spice level, and it was spicy, but not so spicy that it took away from the taste. The sweetness of the sauce helped cut the spice. There will be some bone in this one for those who have never tried this dish. The Gamja tang was just so-so to my taste buds. One person in my party said he really enjoyed the broth as he felt it had a different depth to it than the others he has had before at different restaurants. I personally felt that it tasted ""meatier"" or more gamey hence my lackluster response. But the others I was with really liked it.The service is just like any standard Korean restos-to the point and efficient, no loitering and lingering. The food came out quickly and beers/soju were served promptly at our ""yeogiyo"" requests. This is the kind of service I personally love and prefer!The restaurant has a large tv screen on one wall playing Korean music videos-at least the entire time I was there, that's what was playing. Acoustics make the place a bit loud, so if you are looking for a quiet intimate atmosphere, this is not the place. All in all, pretty good food and service.

25,2023-09-14,2023-09-17,Mother Tongue,"This restaurant is such a hidden gem. First off, it's difficult to find this place. I think I walked around the block three times. It's tucked within an alleyway and there's an elevator that takes you to the restaurant. It's beautifully decorated in every way. You can tell they really put effort and thought into the design and little touches. Everything from the furniture to the tableware to the glasses, to the lamps on the tables, it's so well executed and stylish. Very photo-worthy. Lots of seating inside and there's an outdoor section as well where you get a decent view of Hollywood.My friend and I each ordered an aperol spritz, a classic.Toasted Walnut Muhummara: This dip was so comforting and delicious. A nice way to start off the meal. A savory dip served with freshly warm pita bread. Best eaten fresh, once the pita gets cold it gets tough.Shittake Mushroom Larb: This is so fun to look at, and so fun to eat. There's a crunchy rice sheet over each lettuce wrap, each one is filled with mushrooms and tofu. Great combination of flavors and textures as there's some lime in it too. This is a must get and it's great for sharing. It gets a little messy, there will be some drippage on your hands, but it's worth it.Seven-Vegetable Cous Cous: A stunning dish. A bowl with the vegetable medley comes along with a side bowl of cous cous. This was good but my least favorite out of what we ordered.Pacifico Striped Bass: This is a dish that will make you say ""wow"" when you eat it. It's served in a coconut broth and there are scallop pieces included too.

She was thoughtful with every recommendation, she anticipated our every need. Love her and would come back just for the service. The food was good. The drinks were okay. But what was lacking in those areas was more than made up for with her as our server. No complaints about the food or beverages, everything was good.

25,2023-08-25,2023-09-17,Mother Tongue,"We came here for my bday dinner-I called the restaurant asking if I can push the time out, the girl who picked up was extremely rude. I told her I'm texting my sisters right now to figure out how late we would be as I am a prompt person, I was asked to call back rudely once I had a time. I was taken aback not what she said but how she said it. I suggest to hire a person who knows how to speak to the public as first impressions kind of matter, especially in a fine dining establishment like this one. ‍ we were exactly 15 minutes late. I thought it would be swamped, I'd actually feel better on how she the handled phone call, it was not.In terms of food, it was decent.The whipped avocado was yum! I did not care for the roasted beef hummus but interesting to say the least.The hand cut steak tartare was amazingThe Duck was a tad saltyThe American wagyu was apparently medium but really tasted medium rare in my opinion but the yucca fries were so goodOverall it was good, they lost three stars for the initial interaction which kind of put a damper in my evening, and irked me a tad. We also asked if we can sit outside, she said it was reserved...ughh that evening the restaurant looked pretty slow, def not a full house, but whatever. We went outside, def empty seating, thanks for trying to accommodate. For 500 bucks, I expected a tad better service, but our waitress did made up for the rude initial interaction.","960 N La Brea Ave Fl 4 Los Angeles, CA 90038",4.1,282,"American (New), Seafood, Vegetarian",

26,2023-08-31,2023-09-17,Juliana Los Angeles,"My friends and I really wanted to like this place and support a fellow Korean American new business, so it saddens me to have to write this review.As some other 1 star reviews have mentioned, I was very surprised to see so many 5 star reviews of this establishment - take a deep breath because this is gonna be a long one.We made reservations for 6:45PM for a party of four. Host was friendly when we entered and upon telling her we had reservations she told us it was open seating and to sit wherever we like. They don't have standard tables, it is a ""lounge concept"" (their words not mine) with one long communal table in the middle and then a bunch of small round tables along each side of the walls. What was strange was as we were waiting for our order I saw the servers putting out 'reserve' signs and arranging tables - did our reservation not fall under that category?Interior is cute, very instagrammable. Dinnerware seemed very cheap. This place hasn't even been open for very long and the paint coating on the silverware was already 80% chipped off, which also made it look dirty. Glassware was sticky.We were excited to try all the food so here's what we ordered:Green Tangerine Ade (-10/10): No flavor. Glass it was served in was extremely sticky all around the outside.Truffle Fries (-10/10):  the most generic brand of frozen fries. Pale, soggy, limp - not crispy at all. Fried in a gang of oil and then tossed lightly in some truffle oil. No aioli, served with ketchup on the saddest looking plate. This was our bad, should've expected something like this for $6.Ceviche (1/10): served in a martini cup, which did not look food safe with 5 christmas tortilla chips. What we ordered did not look like the photo posted on yelp at all. We received less than 1/4 cup of ceviche. Only redeeming quality was the lemon was good.Prosciutto Bruschetta (-10/10): this should not even be called bruschetta. Bruschetta usually consists of grilled bread rubbed with garlic, topped with tomatoes, olive oil, etc. What we got was 2 tiny thick a** pieces of stale bread topped with the biggest mountains of ricotta cheese and two halves of a cherry tomato on top. no seasoning, ricotta tasted sour.Grilled Pulpo (3/10): this only gets a 3 because it was cooked very well, the octopus was tender, but the seasoning tasted like kids applesauce (very sweet) and there was no chimichurri sauce as shown in the photos.At this point we asked our server if it was possible to cancel the rest of our order because we were so disappointed with everything that came out so far. The gentleman came back to tell us it was too late, end of story. It would have been nice if he asked what was wrong with the food or if there was something they could do to remedy the situation.Herb Crisped Lamb Chop (0/10): 0 because we never received it. Actually kind of glad this one didn't come out because all the food we had tasted so far was not good.Tenderloin (3/10): this also gets a 3 because the cook on the steak was tender. Definitely not worth $35. The steak also had an extremely sweet seasoning that tasted like fruit rollups to me. Strange. The same server we asked to cancel our order with brought out this dish and he just seemed over it b/c we had previously asked if it was possible to cancel. The dish comes out with a dome lid with smoke inside - there was no presentation of the food, he dropped the plate on the table, took the lid off and walked away LOL. No description of the steak seasoning on the menu.Lobster Risotto (-10/10): the absolute worst. When the server brought this out I thought it was a korean pancake. It was drowning in a soup of ""gambas"" oil (also not mentioned on the menu) and was so overcooked it was basically a porridge. Lobster was undercooked and tasted like it had gone bad.My friends and I will normally finish as much as we can because what a waste of food! We're also not the pickiest eaters and are not that hard to please. However, these dishes were quite inedible so we asked for our check. There was another female server who came over with our bill and when we were explaining why we were leaving she was very apologetic, which is why I'm giving a 3 for service. The other dude should not be working in the service industry. A manager or server did not come over once during our stay to ask how things were or to ask if there was anything they could do to improve our experience. I have worked in many restaurants and typically if a customer is that dissatisfied with the food, the restaurant will comp some items. We actually had to remind them to remove the lamp chops from our bill b/c we never received it. We paid the entire bill + tip and as soon as we got up to leave we could see all the servers swarming to our table to clean it up and it seemed like they were badmouthing us. Not a good look, they could've at least waited until we were out of sight hahaha.Avoid. Avoid. Avoid.","3500 W 6th St Los Angeles, CA 90020",4.2,69,"Breakfast & Brunch, Lounges, Tapas/Small Plates",

27,2023-08-28,2023-09-17,Apb,"I visited on a Saturday evening at around 7:30pm and was pleased to find that the restaurant wasn't overly crowded. The visual appeal of the establishment was truly impressive. In terms of pricing, I would classify it as mid to slightly on the pricier side. For our party of four, the bill totaled around $250, covering four rolls, one appetizer, and four drinks.The standout item from our meal was undoubtedly the ceviche tacos. As someone who appreciates vegan cuisine, I did have high hopes for the rolls, but unfortunately, they didn't leave a strong impression. The faux fish texture was a bit too gelatinous for my liking. The overall concept is intriguing, though.When it comes to the drinks, the alcoholic options were decent but not extraordinary. They lacked a strong alcoholic taste. If you're considering ordering a drink, I'd recommend opting for the nonalcoholic choices, which seemed to have better flavor profiles.","7302 Melrose Ave Los Angeles, CA 90036",4.8,65,"Cocktail Bars, Vegan",

With the cheese Buldak we got a medium spicy which wasn't too spicy, if i were to go back, i'd get spicer. Would definitely want to try the pasta next time as well. Perfect way to end the night.

29,2023-09-01,2023-09-17,Louders,"The Stir-Fried Baby Octopus and Pork Belly was so good, I can handle a spice pretty well, but I prefer things to be not as spicy as what my spice limit is because for me, overly spicy things takes away from actual flavor (though I'm sure some people like to burn their mouth), we got medium (보통) spicy and it was perfect. It comes out on a stone pan thing so the rice starts to crisp up at the bottom! So generous with the octopus and pork too. We both weren't feeling that hungry, so we had enough leftover that we could each take a to-go bowl home. We also got the cajun fries (not pictured), which were light and perfectly seasoned. The service here is not remarkable, it's just your standard Korean type of service, so your server might seem cold but that's just the way it is. We went during lunch so it wasn't crowded, but I can imagine it being a lot more busy at night because they are technically a pocha at the end of the day.","3470 W 6th St Los Angeles, CA 90020",4.5,518,"Asian Fusion, Chicken Shop",$$

The food also took quite a while to come out, and there was quite a bit of wait between each dish being brought out. My favorite dishes from most to least favorite were the soy garlic wings, kimchi bacon udon carbonara, stir fried pork belly, and spicy cheese rice cake. The glaze on the wings was delicious, and the chicken was fried to perfection. The pasta had a unique flavor and was tasty. The stir fried pork belly was solid. For me personally, I'd prefer if the rice cake had a bit of other things in it, like ramen or even sausages. PSA: all the dishes are kind of on the smaller size, so don't expect to leave here feeling super full! They played Kpop on the TVs the entire time I was there, which kept me entertained as I waited for the food. For parking, we parked a few streets away and just walked over, which was not a big issue for us.

And our cocktails were PERFECTION down to the ice- which we always pay attention to! Highly recommend the Old Fashioned and Negroni.My only rub with our dining experience (and why I gave 4 stars instead of 5) was that usually when a patron is asked to order all their food items at once, this means that the food will be coursed out and timed. But all of our food was brought out within minutes of us ordering and it all came at once which felt rushed and a little overwhelming. Our table was too small for all we ordered too LOL I felt like we had to eat the hot food first and then get to the cold apps as we could, as opposed to a more relaxed dining experience where we could take our time and enjoy things more intentionally.But, nonetheless, the food was delicious and the service was great!

But the octopus was expertly cooked, it was so tender! The mac and cheese and the braised kale were both delicious, but because everything else was so stellar, they wound up seeming just OK by comparison.The Dusk on the Delta was a really nice version of a highball. My friend got a Punk Evans. The presentation was very striking with the watermelon ice cubes. Unfortunately, the drink was only fully realized once it melted and combined into the drink to balance it out some.

The crisp on the duck skin was perfect and the salad that accompanied it brought some brightness to cut the richness of the duck meat.- banana custard pie: the sage in the crust was so delicate and delicious, the lightness of the coconut chantilly cream offset the richness of the custard perfectly- Valerie's Voodoo cocktail: herbaceous and well-balanced tiki drinkThe less good- blue crab gratin en cocotte: too rich for me with crab and cheese. But for those who enjoy blue crab, it is an incredibly generous portion! And the Old Bay seasoned crackers were a clever touch.- romanesco cauliflower: a little bland- cornbread: a little greasy for my taste- Son of a Sailor milk punch: very understated and not as flavorful as I wanted","770 S Grand Ave Ste A Los Angeles, CA 90017",4.8,33,"Southern, American (New), Seafood",

The kimchi fried rice was sooooo good as well, I would say this is a must for patrons.The service was pretty quick and helpful, and the ambiance was LA modern, pretty nice vibe.Now back to parking, we only found paid parking across the street.

31,2023-09-14,2023-09-17,TOKKI - Korean Tapas,"Really disappointed as I was so excited to try this spot!Everything was just underwhelming.. I ordered the white rabbit cocktail and it was really bland/plain. We ordered the uni toast which was not worth the $42 by any means. It's essentially Texas toast, thousand island dressing, pickles, and uni. It was good, it almost tasted like an uni Big Mac. But no where near the cost. Uni is everywhere, especially in ktown, and good uni doesn't cost that much. Next we had the scallop crudo. It's 2 large scallops, but they slice the scallops in thirds (top, middle, bottom) so it appears like 6 pieces. Again, really disappointing to see them cheap out and cut corners like that. How about just serving 6 scallops? The tteokbokki was super westernized, instead of the normal sweet/spicy flavor, it's in pasta sauce with basil and Parmesan cheese. Honestly it was gross. Then we got the crispy pork belly. The fat is SO sticky it glues your mouth shut, it's unbelievable. Barely any meat, just fat, can't believe they even sold it like that. Lastly, we got both desserts. The black sesame dessert was delicious, though I wish it was more than just a smear across the plate. And the cheesecake was disappointing. Not rich and creamy, instead it was airy and dry.The restaurant is also no longer busy and I can guess why. We had a 7:30pm reservation and it was about half full and nearly empty by the time we left at 9pm. So you can't even blame the poor quality on their business/rush.Really wish we could have had a better experience.","3465 W 6th St Los Angeles, CA 90020",4.5,484,"Korean, Tapas/Small Plates, Cocktail Bars",

32,2023-09-16,2023-09-17,Pixiu Mala Hongtang,"I don't like leaving negative reviews on Yelp, and I don't usually engage in that. As a business owner myself, I understand the impact a casually written review can have, and I'm cautious about writing reviews. Especially in these tough economic times due to COVID-19, I want to support local businesses even more. However, I felt the need to leave a review today.In conclusion, I went alone and ended up paying $50 just for a bowl without a tip. At this price point, I could have gone to a place like M Grill and been much more satisfied. Here, it's a buffet-style system where you serve yourself and the food is cooked and brought to your table. The price is determined by weight, but why don't they tell you the price upfront? Why make you calculate it after you've already eaten? Their intentions were clear, and it left a bad taste in my mouth.To get to the point, I filled a very large plate with a little bit of everything. Since it was my first time here and my first time trying these foods, I asked the server if the amount I had was okay for one person. Her response was, ""Oh, it looks like you're very hungry, hoho."" My intention was simply to ask if I had taken too much for one person, not for some strange and irrelevant comment like that. But she insisted it was fine even though it was quite a lot.In the end, I filled two to-go boxes to the brim and took them home. So, I basically prepared three servings for myself. Why don't they tell you the price by weight upfront, so that the staff knows that what you're serving is too much for one person, especially for a first-time customer?The intention is very clear at this part. And why don't they ask if it's your first time? I had no idea if it was a self-serve system, and I sat there for over 10 minutes without getting any water or a menu. Later on, they realized I was a first-time customer and thought I was choosing my food from the menu. I mean, sitting alone for over 10 minutes as a first-time customer is pretty obvious, isn't it? Also, shouldn't there be at least two staff members working? One person handling cash, one in the kitchen, and one in the dining area, all while making me wait for over 10 minutes... Well, it was truly the worst dining experience I've ever had. I really, genuinely feel like I was scammed. Please don't run your business like this.And these kinds of reviews shouldn't make you feel bad; on the contrary, you should be grateful. Seriously, if I had wanted this place to fail, I wouldn't have pointed out these issues and would have just let it go under.","425 S Western Ave Los Angeles, CA 90020",4.3,114,"Chinese, Hot Pot, Korean",$$

They also played jazz in the background lol.First, you go down an aisle of ingredients and put everything into a big bowl. I always get a lot of cabbages, bok choys, spinach, mushrooms, tofus and noodles. At the counter, I ask them to add beef brisket for an additional charge. You then choose a spice level. I got level 1.5 today just to see how it is (im going to try level 3 next time). Then, you have a seat and they cook it for you in the meantime. You pay at the end depending on the weight of the food.I was so happy when our food came out. I was initially worried that they'd just jumble up all the food and boil it all at once, but it they def have a particular order of cooking the ingredients.

32,2023-08-22,2023-09-17,Pixiu Mala Hongtang,"If you're craving malatang, this is the place to go! As you may know, you grab a bowl and fill it with all the veggies and noodles. Those go by weight so be mindful of how much you're adding. Towards the end, there are skewers but beware, you pay per skewer. When you take your bowl to the counter, they'll ask if you want to add any meat. They'll add that when they're cooking your soup so it's a fixed amount. You can get anywhere from 0 to 4 spice. The base soup has a strong peanut flavor and the more spice, the better! 1 is really minimal so I'd recommend a 2-3 if you like spicy, obviously a 4 if you want that extraaa kick.The lady who served our table was sooo sweet.

The place is clean and the ingredients also seem fresh.You grab ingredients from an open cold bar, then you go to the cashier to choose your meat option. The price is determined by weight. You can choose to have it dry style or soup style - we chose dry but in hindsight I wish we chose the broth because it felt like you were eating a lot of the chilies straight up, which was distracting.I'd also mention this place is korean-fied so the flavors would be a bit more mild than what authentic calls for (didn't get much of the numbing sensation).Overall, it was enjoyable but fell a little short of the strong mala flavor we were originally craving!","425 S Western Ave Los Angeles, CA 90020",4.3,114,"Chinese, Hot Pot, Korean",$$

32,2023-08-11,2023-09-17,Pixiu Mala Hongtang,"such tasty broth! the broth is peanut based and i felt like  this flavor with the medium hot spice level 1 was perfect for me. i also tried the hot spice level 2 and felt like it was more of a numbing spice from the Sichuan pepper, which i don't really enjoy but would recommend to those who enjoy that type of spice.there are a variety of addins that you add yourself. the price of your bowl is based on weight and you can add beef brisket for an extra $3.99. my bowl was around $20~ including beef which imo was a great deal considering how much food i got! left with so much as well.we came during dinner time on a saturday and there was plenty of seating and staff was friendly.","425 S Western Ave Los Angeles, CA 90020",4.3,114,"Chinese, Hot Pot, Korean",$$

At the self service area you'll find an arrangements of different noodles, proteins like fish cake and tofu and veggies. You bring it to counter where they will weigh your food (this is what determines your meals cost) and you ask them to make it as a hot pot or a dry pot (stir fry)! Both options are tasty but personally I thought the dry pot was excellent. Super flavorful and unique.You can really not get tired of this place because you get to pick your own destiny here hahaAlso there is a valet parking lot.

It provided plenty of space and comfortable seating for our group of 30 guests. Talia, our host for the evening, was an absolute pleasure.

My husband & I came here this past Thursday and got great seating inside with a view of the incredibly beautiful bar (Shining vibes but so much better) and they had a DJ who I would come back every night for. He played the best mix of cool/sultry/chill at the perfect volume. The drinks & food were fantastic, had the Old Fashioned Sour & the passion fruit cocktail. Both were delicious, but I LOVED the Old Fashioned Sour. The presentation was great too; nice heavy glassware, the ""good"" ice--all of it. :) Food was also fabulous, had the calamari & charcuterie to start, and then had the kale salad & the barbacoa nachos which were AMAZING, and the chocolate cake was maybe (definitely) the best chocolate cake of my entire life. Everything was reasonably priced, and portions and quality were great. The staff was SO nice & so helpful, and lovely all around. They have an adorable large outdoor seating area, but inside was too gorgeous not to enjoy. The restroom is also such a cool & beautiful space that oozes the same Hollywood golden age vibe.

Sadly, this was not the case when we went in Saturday night. A group of about 8-10 of us came in after attending a concert downtown Saturday night and sat at a table for 30 mins without being acknowledged. It was busy, I get it.. but we weren't rude, weren't loud, so I thought this was odd. I asked a server if we could order drinks and she responded rudely, ""I'm not your server, give me a few minutes"". 10 minutes passed and still no one came over, so naturally we left. It's rare for me to leave a review, but I won't stand for poor service.

After looking through the menu we all decided to get American Breakfast which consists of eggs your way, choice of bacon or chicken sausage, breakfast potatoes, toast.  We all got the scramble eggs and chicken sausage.  We also added 3 seasonal fruit bowls, 2 English breakfast, and 2 coffees and 2 cappuccinos.  Everything was delicious, simple dishes cooked perfectly which tells you about their chef.  Egg was silky and tasty.  The breakfast potatoes were the best crispy potatoes that I had in the recent year.  Cappuccino was brewed just right which made me want to have 2nd one if I wasn't already full from the breakfast plate.  We will definitely come back to try other dishes at Mes Amis.","1541 Wilcox Ave Los Angeles, CA 90028",4.3,63,"French, Brasseries",

I guess even at about $400 for two people with tip and tax for wine and appetizers, we were still wasting their time and not spending enough.I think I'll have to get some therapy because I can't get over how horrible this experience was.","1541 Wilcox Ave Los Angeles, CA 90028",4.3,63,"French, Brasseries",

34,2022-12-30,2023-09-17,Mes Amis,"I was disappointed mostly in service with this place. Let me say that our server was very kind but I was frustrated with small things that added up for me. First thing, I think it's necessary to be told when a refill of a soda is extra charge, they serve very small glasses so obviously a refill is expected but when I ask for a refill, I think it's a server's duty to inform a person there aren't complimentary refills. $6 for a tiny refill of soda is ridiculous when I HIGHLY doubt a whole can was even used for my 2 orders of soda. We also ordered some extra bread for the table, the server again didn't mention it isn't complimentary after 2 servings for a party of our size of 6. We were charged $8 for an extra order of their bread. Second, I told the server I wanted dessert for my entree, I know she heard me cuz we laughed about it. I had to ask about my chocolate souflee when everyone else's entree came out, she said she rang it in as a dessert. I was annoyed and confused cuz I literally said ""I'll have dessert as my ENTREE"". She informed me they take 18 minutes to cook, I became annoyed even more cuz I had to sit there while everyone ate except me.Overall, I wouldn't come back, solely due to my frustrations with the lack of communication. Can't speak on anything else cuz I didn't have anything and I paid over $60 just for soda, bread and dessert.","1541 Wilcox Ave Los Angeles, CA 90028",4.3,63,"French, Brasseries",

A good friend of mine makes wine in Buelton and when he told me the chef of a delicious seafood and steak house opened a restaurant in Los Angeles, I freaked. Not only does the space feel extremely spacious, the booths suck you in. The server was smooth and quick, grabbing our entire order to allow up the time to relax and enjoy the flow of courses. We had so much food it was really a lovely experience. Everything was coursed perfectly and the meal and wine we brought in were so complimentary. A 1970s Somera style Tempranillo and a 2018 CdP. We spent a little over three hours eating and laughing and with two corkage fees, three drinks, three glasses of wine, the seafood tower, two salads, three entrees and sides for days it was a modest $600 bill.

After you walk in thru a screen door, follow the hallway to the back to go to the backyard. It has tons of covered outdoor seating and a very nice vibe. Perfect for a date or a group. The food itself is typical Korean bar food. Pasta, chicken, other finger foods. We got the pasta and the fried chicken. The pasta was good, but not enough kimchi flavor. The chicken tasted fine, but had too much flour to it and it wasn't super crunchy, a bit soggy honestly, even after eating immediately when it came out. Service wise, they were pretty busy when I went so it took a while to get anything... Parking, they have a valet service in front of the building.

More breading to chicken ratio so you'll definitely have a food coma.

The ambiance was exceptionally cool, creating a fantastic atmosphere for a delightful evening. The lighting added to the overall charm of the place.One highlight was their extensive wine selection, which offered a wide variety of options to complement the meal. I chose the bolognese pasta and rice balls, and they were both exceptionally delicious. The bolognese had a rich and savory flavor, while the rice balls were crispy on the outside and bursting with flavor on the inside.My friend got veal raviolis and they melted in your mouth.In addition to these highlights, the restaurant had much more to offer, making it a memorable dining experience.

I ended up ordering the seafood pasta but just with shrimp haha same thing but whatever. I asked for no spice since I was with my children. I said no spice like 3 times to her because again- children.Tel me why the pasta came with spice. I waited to tell her for a good 15 minutes but again since she didn't show to ask how we were doing... I had to run downstairs.The man working downstairs was amazing and I wish he were the host cause he took my pasta no questions asked and brought a new one. The only problem was it was brought after everyone had eaten and right before we left.Idk I left disappointed and not satisfied.

Restaurant is near the pool which that day there were children running around, back and forth from the table to the pool.

What was meant to be a memorable birthday dinner turned into a nightmare that I wouldn't wish upon my worst enemy. The dishes were not only tasteless and poorly presented, It was as if the chef had taken a haphazard approach, tossing ingredients together without any thought or care. Every bite was a reminder of the money wasted on this dining experience. To make matters worse, instead of allowing us to enjoy our meal, the security guard seemed determined to rush us out of the restaurant. We were constantly interrupted and pressured to finish our plates, even though we had barely taken a few bites. It felt as if they were more interested in turning tables than ensuring customer satisfaction. As if this wasn't enough, the climax of this horrendous evening came when we were abruptly escorted out of the restaurant by security. It was my friend's birthday, and we had gathered to celebrate and enjoy a pleasant evening together. Which turned out to be one of the worst birthday celebrations.","6417 Selma Ave Los Angeles, CA 90028",3.7,435,"Breakfast & Brunch, American (New), Acai Bowls",$$

However, they refused to give us two separate tables (it was a birthday party for teens so we wanted to let the teens sit at their own table). They also said each person needed toorder their ""own"" entree, so no sharing a pizza even. I'm not eating an entire pizza myself. In addition, they require each person to spend at least $65 excluding drinks if there's more than 8 in the party. If this restaurant is really that strapped for cash it shouldn't bother. The hoops to jump through to eat there are ridiculous. They honestly have such a bad pretentious attitude we just left. It's a pizza restaurant. Who do they think they are? There are dozens of similar pizza places in LA that aren't trying to take advantage of their patrons and honestly have better pizza. Just an unpleasant experience all around.

I can't believe how amazing an experience this was -- the owner himself Jocelyn Bulow was such a kind, inviting, and amazing person -- I had no idea he was the owner because he was so hands-on and attentive in making sure our experience was great. He treated us like guests to his home (explaining us the menu, checking in on us, making sure we enjoying ourselves) . He has such a wonderful and happy personality -- the hospitality was second nature.All we were looking for was a dog friendly dinner option that had alcohol and found it as a top recommended spot. The ambiance felt like we were back in Europe out in the Patio. Now, because of the wonderful experience, we'll visit this local Europe on a weekly basis!The food was spectacular... from start to finish -- the perfectly grilled Octopus (soft and fresh) and its amazing zesty dip, the Marinara Pizza had the perfect balance of sauce and chew + crunch on the dough, the Sofia mussels had depth, the bread and quality olive oil (you can taste it), we were so full by the end and so satisfied. I really want to try their dessert next time when I have more room in my stomach.The really cool part about too something the owner did on his own. One of the problems sometimes sitting in patio spaces in different restaurants are smokers who dwell in front of patio... most times in LA I always feel like we have to deal with it ourselves, or directly ask the waiters to help. In OSTE, the owner did this on his own because of how much he cares about the people eating. I was really impressed with how he cared and the way he did it was so kind to the smokers, respectful in every way.We can't wait to come back.

Please note that parking can be a tad bit challenging as there are mainly street parking spots.To start off, the exceptional service immediately caught my attention. The staff create personalized and more meaningful interactions with diners. They worked in a fast pace but not in a way where we felt rushed to eat our meal. They were very attentive as they were always quick to refill our waters and collect any empty dishes and trash. They offered plenty of help with describing the menu the moment you sit down. They also add to the Italian restaurant's ambiance by speaking Italian here and there.I cannot stress enough how amazingly fresh the food was. You will first be asked if you want to start off with an appetizer called Homemade Bread & Evoo for $3. You can clearly taste how freshly made the bread is. Everything came out fresh and at a pretty decent pace. We also ordered 2 pizzas to share, and considering we were a party of 4, the waiter knew to ask if we wanted our pizzas to be sliced into 8 instead of the standard 6.

40,2023-09-07,2023-09-17,The Front Yard,"TL:DR - Beautiful outdoor seating, friendly service, tasty foodI came here with a couple of co-workers for a business-esque lunch and was pleasantly surprised by the restaurant. Located next to The Garland Hotel, The Front Yard is an aesthetic restaurant that serves contemporary American dishes. The outdoor seating is very beautiful and there is enough shade to keep everyone cool during these hot summers.I normally don't order fried chicken sandwiches but for whatever reason, I had to get one today. The chicken was cooked properly, not too dry or undercooked (god forbid) and it wasn't overly battered. Honestly, the sandwich was good, nothing that Wow'd me, but also wasn't bad. It's exactly what I wanted and for the right price. The fries that came with it were also good, just standard good fries. I wish I could explain more, but it was just what you would expect, no crazy ingredients, no fancy fusions, just a good fried chicken sandwich that left me feeling satisfied.The wait-staff was incredibly accommodating and even wore a mask for us when serving and taking our order. That's super rare as I'm writing this in fall 2023 and we're going through another covid wave.Overall, a great time location for grabbing a relaxed lunch and getting some good food. I'll definitely be back if I'm in Burbank or North Hollywood.","4222 Vineland Ave North Hollywood, CA 91602",4.0,3369,"American (New), Breakfast & Brunch, Beer, Wine & Spirits",$$

Everything was good that we went again in the same week lol. I think this place is ran by 2 women, but they always seems so busy. It might take a few minutes for them to take your order bc they're busy back in the kitchen. One thing that was off was that usually when you order kimbap they can give some kind of soup on the side which we had requested, but one of the ladies kinda questioned it and gave it like she was forced to.

It's a Korean mom cooking for you, and the way she cooks is utter perfection. The Kimchi dumplings are a bit spicier than Pao Jao, but in a good way.

43,2023-09-09,2023-09-17,Sparrow Italia,"I chose this dinner spot on vacation for our party of 7 solely because the top reviews and pictures. We wanted to go somewhere in downtown LA with a nice ambiance, great food and drinks. This place fell no short of that!We had James as our server and he was AMAZING. He came out of the gates very knowledgeable of the drink menu and recommendations for each of us. All of the cocktails we ordered had a WOW element, either dry ice, smoke, or fire was involved. I had the campania ($19) and the Sardinia ($21) which were both light and refreshing.We started with a few appetizers (2) braised meatballs ($20 each) and a truffle pizza ($38). The meatballs were so tender and had the most addicting sauce. The pizza was loaded with truffle and the Parmesan cream sauce was the perfect pair. HIGHLY recommend both of those apps.For our entrees, we had the hardest time deciding but James ensured everything on the menu was amazing. My friend and I had the bone marrow pasta ($32 each) which stole the show!! This was my favorite dish! In our group, they ordered the lobster pasta ($75) cacio y Pepe with truffle ($32+ Truffle price), Bolognese ($32) and Wagyu Alla Vodka Pizza ($28).We were so stuffed from the food and drinks and wanted dessert but there was no way we could do it. We decided to take pictures after in the hotel courtyard and it was the perfect aesthetic. Our experience overall was a great start to our vacation. This is a perfect place for a date night out or for a group gathering- 10/10 recommend and definitely will be coming back on my next visit to LA.","939 S Figueroa St. Ste 200 Los Angeles, CA 90015",4.0,506,"Italian, Mediterranean",$$$

The service was good nothing stuck out but the device was good.They have a prefixed brunch menu I tried to order a drink I saw on yelp but they didn't have the ingredients for it because they had prefixed brunch cocktails. I can't remember the name of my drink but it was very good tasted like a peach spritz. Next I had the Sparrow Carbanaro and when I tell you it was TASTY it really was. I wasn't sure how I felt about a egg on my pizza but it fit just in. I usually like ranch on my pizza but everything on this pizza complimented each other there was NO need to add anything else to it. Next I had the pistachio pasta, I'm not the biggest fan of arugula and it's definitely a main ingredient in the sauce and other but I can taste the arugula for sure.

Also I'm not sure why they had open reservations for our time slot because as soon as we sat down they told us the kitchen was about to close and we had to order everything right away.We ended up getting two orders of the gnocchi pasta which was pretty much just a small portion of tomato sauce and gnocchi topped with mozzarella cheese. We also got the egg pizza which was literally just like Georgian khachapuri.The drinks were decent, nothing crazy good to remember.  The ambiance was fine for brunch since it was outdoors and you could see the hotel pool but there were flies buzzing around near us which was annoying.Overall, i wouldn't recommend this place as a good brunch spot.

They opened about a week ago, but as much as I wanted to go right away, I waited patiently so that my foodie friend could accompany me.Their original location is in Arcadia, so we had high hopes, and we weren't disappointed. It's a cute, comfortable spot (with table service!) in the courtyard near the Target/Best Buy. We settled in and made our choices, starting healthy with the smashed cucumber salad, which was light and refreshing. Then it was on to the Mouthwatering Chicken, a cold app that was indeed mouthwatering (and the chicken was tender), with a subtle heat to it. It reminded me a little of Hainan chicken, which is not a bad thing at all. Then, it was time for Dan Dan noodles--which were mildly spicy in a just barely numbing way and absolutely delicious--and pork dumplings, which were juicy and yummy. All of the food was absolutely on point, and it was fun to watch the chef in the back working the noodles by hand.Service is very friendly, though like any brand-new restaurant, they're still working out some little things (like what individual dishes to bring with shared noodle platters, though I think tonight we figured out that small bowls are perfect). The food is already outstanding, and I have no doubt the service stuff will get ironed out in the coming weeks. What a great addition to the neighborhood food scene.

My friend was full so I was happy to eat the majority of this dish :)Definitely want to come back here asap! Lots of other dishes I'm curious to try, in addition to the cocktails, and we heard the mango sticky rice is a must get.

We got the shrimp ceviche, the egg pizza, and the dutch baby pancake. I have to admit, I had no idea what that pancake would be like and it surprised me. It was more like a bread pudding and wasn't bad. The egg pizza with bacon was ok, I just wished it had more egg. The ceviche tasted pretty fresh, but I really found myself wishing it was just regular chips, not the chili lime chips they had. It was just not the right flavor combo for me.As a side note, the wait staff was nice but after taking our order we never saw our waiter again.

46,2023-09-13,2023-09-17,Bacari Silverlake,"I have now been to Bacari 3 times, and I have to say I love it! Bacari is such a beautiful restaurant. It is always so lively, which makes it hard to get a table unless you are patient or book a reservation a week in advance, but that doesn't bother me. I love how lively it is. The food is great. I have had some of my favorite meals here. I have some different pointers on how you should order though, because some of the things I've had, I definitely would not order again.1. Best thing there: The Lamb Hummus. It's amazing. I could eat that every day. The only issue is that they only provide ONE single tiny pita for it. And the amount of hummus they give you could literally serve at least 6 of those pita breads. The pita breads are also SO amazing, they're so so fresh. But it's a bummer because you always have to order at least one extra pita, which is another $2.2. The burrata caprese is so good.3. Papas Bravas are alright, strange proportions.4. Oaxacan Pasta is delicious!!! I had never tried this type of pasta before, so maybe that's why I love it, but I get this every time.5. Brussel Sprouts are my second favorite thing on the menu, to the hummus of course. The Brussel sprouts have the best flavor, and they also have the greatest proportion/serving size I would say. Always order these.6. Chipotle chicken wings are super not great. I am a HUGE chicken wing connoisseur and so I was extremely disappointed by these, my friend and I couldn't even finish them. They were just weird. Weird flavor, and the skin was like soggy and just weird.7. The La Brea Rose is such a delicious and unique drink. I can't really describe it, but you gotta try it!!!Overall, I love Bacari, I will be back over and over. The staff here is great, and the food is awesome. The next thing I need to try is their $30 90 minute open bar wine special!","3626 Sunset Blvd Los Angeles, CA 90026",4.6,2350,"Mediterranean, Breakfast & Brunch, Cocktail Bars",

Great spot for celebrating anything or just a night out for good drinks and food. It's small plates so good for sharing and tasting a lot of the menu. The outdoor patio up top get really dark so reading the menu can be hardOnly reason for 4 stars instead of 5 was the Service could have been a little better. Our first server was pretty good but she ended up getting moved to take over another servers section who had to leave and the second server we got was not very attentive and we were constantly waiting on her to come back.

Parking is horrible so get there early to look for parking or they do have a valet option but that also get filled up quickly. Let me start by saying the ambiance is great. We sat outside on the middle deck since there was another one above us and the ground floor was below. We were in a corner secluded which was nice since it was a date night. We were giving recommendations by the server on what food we should try based on our food likes. Let me say everything that came out was delicious!! We were both stuffed but the food was good we did not want to leave any so we ate more than we should've. They have a great drink menu and I went with the mad mango sour. More on the sour part but good nonetheless. For dessert we had the best cake you will ever have, that is the name of the cake and let me tell you it holds on to that name. We almost ordered another to go but with having more than enough food in our bellies we decided against it.

The sleek, contemporary design sets the tone for an elegant dining experience, while the warm lighting and comfortable seating make you feel right at home.The outdoor seating area proved to be a brilliant choice. The temperature was just perfect, and it allowed us to relish our meal while basking in the fresh air and natural surroundings. What impressed us most was the impeccable service. Even though we were seated outside, the attentive staff ensured we were never forgotten. They consistently checked in to see if we needed refills or anything else, making us feel truly valued as customers.Now, let's talk about the drinks. I decided to go with the Haeundae Blue cocktail, a delightful concoction made with rum, coconut milk, and pineapple juice. Not only did it taste heavenly, but its striking blue color made it a perfect candidate for Instagram-worthy photos. The balance of flavors was just right, with the alcohol content not overpowering the tropical essence.As for the food, we couldn't resist sampling some of their offerings. We ordered the fried chicken & fries, and it was a decision we didn't regret. The fried chicken was expertly prepared, boasting a crispy exterior that gave way to succulent, juicy meat inside.

We ended up just going with what seemed popular on Yelp -- tomahawk pork cutlet. Also went for a wild card with the Bulgogi oven risotto. It was very underwhelming. The cutlet came uncut with a basic sweet tomato sauce. Very chewy and tough. I was pretty disappointed. I'd say the risotto was a little bit better, more enjoyable. Service was meh. Food was meh.

Guess it's just our luck.We were the first to be there (restaurant was empty) and 2 more tables arrived after us. Put in our orders and it took half an hour to get our one calamari dish- appetizer. The waiter came out with free bread shortly after, but then we waited and waited and waited.. 40 mins went by and we still haven't seen the next dish.. 2 pasta orders and a large pepperoni pizza.  The other 2 tables also haven't gotten any of their dishes as well, I noticed.  I know if I opted for fast food, I could've gone there, but over an hour wait for 4 dishes?  What the hell was the chef doing?? Picking his nose back there??When my pasta dish (carbonara) finally came out, it was overly salted. When food takes that long to come out, shouldn't it taste at least decent?  I could've made a more decent frozen pizza at home.We canceled the last pasta dish that still hasn't come out, paid our $100+ with tip and left.

We decided to walk on over to the gas station across the street to see if they had wine to bring in.We didn't even take two steps before a man yelled after us. He said, quite rudely, that the parking (an empty lot, btw!) was only for customers. I explained to him that we intended to come in and get dinner but we wanted to buy a bottle first.""How long?"" he asked.

He took the pizza away and told me he'd get me a new one. His reasoning was because of the arugula. After another 15 minutes the pizza came back with more unwashed arugula.  I feel like they could have handled it better. I'm glad they did make me a new pizza, but afterwards, most of the staff came out to look at me, and that was awkward.  Also, bribe me with a dessert or a free pizza or something!

However, I've noticed it's not always consistent. 2 months ago I had the Alfredo for the first time and it was incredible. I had it again last week and it was bland. The pizza doesn't have enough flavor and never seems quite right. Tonight I went and shared the caprese and the calamari. The caprese was made with ricotta although the menu says burrata. I would have told our server but they never came back to check us on. Ricotta just doesn't taste the same in that salad and wasn't what we were anticipating as described on the menu. The calamari had a tasty breading and dipping marinara. However the calamari itself was dried out, likely frozen. I also ordered a glass of wine which on the way out I saw came from a Gallo magnum bottle. The glass was $14. Everywhere online that same entire bottle of Cabernet sells for under $10. There used to be a super nice, helpful youngish Latino guy working there but I haven't seen him in awhile. He seemed like he cared about things and customers but I haven't gotten that vibe from anyone there since he's been gone. Probably won't be back.","901 S La Brea Ave Los Angeles, CA 90036",4.5,344,Italian,$$

50,2023-09-15,2023-09-17,Pine & Crane,"Service was stellar! However, food was not. As a Taiwanese person, I was quite disappointed in the minced pork over rice. The ratio of rice and meat needs improvement and the rice was soggy. Egg wasn't fully cooked and you can tell it needed another 1-2 minutes to boil. The ""Dan Dan"" noodles were not your typical Dan Dan noodles it was more sesame cold peanut noodles which was delish. Portion was tiny though.Aesthetics were great. Didn't seem too crowded and place was clean and tidy.","1521 Griffith Park Blvd Los Angeles, CA 90026",4.3,2964,"Taiwanese, Chinese, Bubble Tea",$$

We came on a Thursday night around 7pm and it wasn't too busy, so we got to sit down to eat without a wait, maybe we just got lucky.You order at the register and then they give you a number and seat you at a table inside. Just beware, the restaurant itself is quite small (so that's why the wait could take awhile or more people order takeout).Since this was our first time here, we wanted to try their popular dishes. We ordered: stir fry cabbage, beef roll, dan dan noodles, mapo tofu, three-cup jidori chicken, pan fried pork buns. I think my favorite dishes were the dan dan noodles, beef roll, and mapo tofu. The mapo tofu was not spicy as other mapo tofu, but you can add chili oil on the side if you want it spicier. The pan fried pork buns were ok, I don't think I would get it again but it wasn't bad.Overall I had a good experience here and would recommend this restaurant if you are ever in the Silverlake area. I will definitely be back the next time I'm in LA.","1521 Griffith Park Blvd Los Angeles, CA 90026",4.3,2964,"Taiwanese, Chinese, Bubble Tea",$$

The cold dishes do change from time to time so definitely a few new things I want to try if it comes back on the menu. The vegetarian mapo tofu also had nice consistency and thickness. The Bok Choy dumplings were pretty good as well. My friend had the minced pork on rice which looked really delicious. It's a small seating area indoors so sometimes there may be a wait. A little cold inside but I do like the dim-ish ambiance. They also serve boba and loose leaf tea.

I've been here countless times now and I always get the beef noodle soup, pork dumplings and if I bring the girlfriend we get some scallion pancakes too (her favvv). The broth of the BNS is just jaw dropping - for real, be careful. You don't want to lose any of that broth because you're in pure shock of what flavor you just experienced. The pork dumplings just never miss and that's that. Overall vibe of the place is dope. We sat at the community table a couple times and that's always chill, I want to recreate that new girl episode there, you know the one. Aight that's enough from me.

50,2023-09-10,2023-09-17,Pine & Crane,"I came on a Friday night and with the high ratings I was expecting the food to be better than average. However, I left a disappointed. Traditional Taiwanese food is citrusy, vinegary, spicy, and umami. Unfortunately, Pine & Crane missed the mark on all four. The food wasn't terrible but not up to standard. It's missing flavor, the food was bland and not made with love and dedication. Beef noodle soup comes with hours of prep and hours of simmering so the beef is falling off the bone. Instead, it tasted like beef stock with a little bits of beef shank. Dan Dan noodles is suppose to be spicy, nutty and fermented. But It just tasted like diluted peanut butter. Lastly, I got the shrimp wonton, again it lacked the flavor profile. The chili wontons it wasn't umami enough.Besides the food, the service was great! Everyone was nice and accommodating.Overall, I won't be coming back based on the food.","1521 Griffith Park Blvd Los Angeles, CA 90026",4.3,2964,"Taiwanese, Chinese, Bubble Tea",$$

You would think the food spot to go to would be Grand Central Market but little do the tourists know, the best food is just across the street in a small restaurant with a private patio that gets you away from the city.The food is amazing. Every time I go I get the Ravioli Di Zucca. I'll either get it for myself or we add it as an appetizer because it is that good. We also always get the garlic bread. It's done so well and one of the best comfort foods.The staff! So friendly, so helpful, and all about you having a great experience.

It was like leftovers, tiny bit of sauce stretched to go with spaghetti at the bottom of pot.After a couple of minutes my husband looked over as he picked out a meatball and asked if mine was as bad as his.Possibly dining experience is a large part of other reviews.

No problem ever comes up except for today. I paid and as I was leaving the restaurant, one of the lady blocked my way and asked me to tip. She was all up in my face forcing me to tip. Yeah, maybe when I'm rich but I'm a broke college student, lower the price or pay the worker the right wages. No one is paying for my gas or time and the bill is coming out to over $40, that's a lot for me but I still come here because of the food. I asked her if I have to tip and she said ""if the service is good and the food is good then I need to tip these amounts"" as she was pointing to the tipping percentages.First of all, service was standard and shouldn't service suppose to be good. I came for the food and paid for it so what's the problem?Secondly, blocking my way and forcing me to tip is considered terrible service for me. I did end up tipping because the lady was blocking my way and not letting me leave unless I tip. I also didn't want to make a scene but this is terrible.

This is straight up one of my favorite spots in LA.If you come here at peak hours there might be a long wait list (that you have physically write your name on with a pen), but it tends to move pretty fast as they are efficient with turning over tables. I also want to note that the servers are always super friendly, which is nice!This is kinda a hole in the wall place. There is counter seating where you can watch the fresh noodles being made, or some cramped tables so I guess it kinda feels like an authentic Japanese experience lol. I don't mean this in a negative way and the food here is so good that I barely even notice that I'm super close to the party seated next to me.I've tried a good amount of the menu at this point and my go to is the miso carbonara udon. The fresh noodles are always so satisfyingly chewy and the miso carbonara sauce is creamy and savory. Tastes even better with a generous sprinkle of togarashi (the red pepper stuff). Italians would probably shudder at the thought of this dish, but sorry Italy it's so very good! I would say if you come here you should stick to their specialty udons over the traditional cause they just have a little more something to them.I also always order my udon with a tempura soft boiled egg (a must!) and whatever other tempura I'm in the mood for. The pumpkin and kakiage are also great choices! The tempura always comes out hot and perfectly fried.During lunch they also offer a special combo of a mini rice bowl with your udon. I love to get the pork belly bowl or the spicy pork, they're both great.I look forward to continuing to visit this spot for as long as I live in LA.","329 E 1st St Los Angeles, CA 90012",4.4,4567,"Japanese, Noodles, Asian Fusion",$$

Not worth the price. I did like the dressing which seemed to be made fresh.* Tofu Agedashi ($6) - 4.5 starsLovely silky soft tofu with a soft thick layer of breading, so tasty half soaked in the broth. The shave daikon was great, refreshing, and added thickness/texture to the broth.HOT UDONS* Beef w Fluffy Jidori Egg Udon ($16.25) - 4 starsThe udon noodles were perfection. This is definitely a filling one, the egg and sliced beef making the broth intense and thick.* Duck Nanban Udon ($16.75) - 4 starsAgain the noodles were fantastic. More simplistic, this comes with a japanese spice you can add that smelled minty to me but has the numbing spice. It countered the duck well, which can be quite intense and gamey. We appreciated that the slices of duck had also been seared to add some char/texture.","329 E 1st St Los Angeles, CA 90012",4.4,4567,"Japanese, Noodles, Asian Fusion",$$

I also liked the cold options, and their signature ones are good for those who want something a little more fusion. Plus the servings are huge - everything comes out in giant bowls!THE WAIT: About a 20-minute wait for four of us at noon on a Saturday.THE SERVICE: Really professional and thorough. The guy who took our order really wanted to get it right, he repeated it back to us to check three times!SIGNATURE UDON* Miso Carbonara (Creamy White Sauce based Udon w/ Bacon, hint of Miso flavor. $12.50) - 3.5 starspic:yelp.com/biz_photos/maru…An interesting mix of western flavors and eastern textures. Definitely a very thick sauce, very heavy, just like you'd expect from a carbonara sauce at an Italian restaurant, and it went surprisingly well with the thick udon noodle thought I couldn't taste the ""hint of Miso flavor'. The thick bits of bacon were great. If you want something more familiar to a western palate or really different for Asian food, this is the way to go, but I wouldn't get this if you're looking for authentic Japanese cuisine.COLD UDON* Bukkake Udon (Cold Udon with Cold Broth. $6.95) - 4.5 starspic:yelp.com/biz_photos/maru…This was great! I was intrigued by the cold udon section, something I'd never had before. The photos made this serving look really small, but it still comes out in a huge bowl. You have to mix the different toppings (radish, bonito flakes, scallion, and tempura pieces) really well together. Once they're all in their right proportions mixed in, then it really tastes right! The radish adds a thickness, the tempura this great crunch, and scallion/bonita extra flavor. You can pour the sauce, in a separate container, over the noodle, but that ends up sinking at the bottom. I found it was better to make your spoon with the noodle and mixed toppings (get some from the bottom; they've invariably clumped there), then pour the sauce over your spoonful. Delicious!I also tried a bit of the Beef Udon (Hot Udon section), which was very classic and tasty. The meat was sliced very thin and was tender.

Service was really attentive as always. It feels like they added more tables or maybe I don't remember because  it's been a while since I've been here.I usually go for the sea urchin udon, miso carbonara, or butter mentaiko squid udon but I've decided to try something different since it was hot and humid that day.I got the beef bukkake cold udon + $3 for double portion this time and I wasn't really a huge fan of the broth. The noodles, meat, and shredded daikon were excellent. The noodles still had that fresh al dente bite to them(nice and chewy), the beef belly wasn't too fatty, and the grated daikon gave it refreshing depth of flavor taste.Their fried chicken has always been on point crispy, tender, seasoned well and it pairs so well with the Japanese mayo/curry seasoning on the side.If you come here you have to definitely get sea urchin udon, miso carbonara, butter mentaiko squid, beef udon, and I would definitely try the curry next time. If you're a fat ass like me then you have the option to get double portion for only $3 more but that only applies for cold udon and hot udon!","329 E 1st St Los Angeles, CA 90012",4.4,4567,"Japanese, Noodles, Asian Fusion",$$

Place is pretty small so I don't recommend for bigger parties. After we left around 7:45 there were a lot of people waiting so def recommend coming before 7.Ordered the mentai cream udon and miso carbonara udon with both being $16.75. Also got the fried chicken which was around $9. Both udon dishes were very tasty, especially the carbonara as the sauce was thick and the bacon flavor really came through. The mentai one had tons of mini scallops and a couple mini shrimp pieces which were nice and soft. However, both are a bit on the smaller side but would rate them a 7.7/10. The fried chicken was nice and crispy with a great umami flavor paired with curry power and Japanese mayo on the side (8/10).Biggest downside was that it did take a while to get our food (about 30 mins for udon) especially the fried chicken which took about 40 mins. It was a bit strange since it was an appetizer and it came when we just about finished our udon. I understand that it was busy but they didn't explain the situation or explain the wait while other tables (who ordered after us) got their food first.Overall would rate place 7/10 and would come again to try the other dishes.","329 E 1st St Los Angeles, CA 90012",4.4,4567,"Japanese, Noodles, Asian Fusion",$$

I've had the Sea Urchin Udon and the Seafood tomato cream udon and both just tasted way more creamy than seafood-y. The udon noodle quality itself is very good and tastes handmade. I also ordered the Sansai Udon which was waaay too salty- I couldn't even finish it and felt the salt on my tongue for an hour after. Their fried chicken was very good and juicy (but not particularly unique). The only reason I've been here so many times is because my partner likes their Creamy Mushroom Udon.

It's flat $20 per bowl with tax, before tip. So for 2 bowls, they brought a laminated total bill of $40. I don't know if they will go back and redo such things once inflation for the cost cools down.

My party of 2 was able to be sat right away, but I've heard that there sometimes is a long line.Food/Drinks: I always like trying places that have a specialty dish, and this place's was seolleongtang: a hearty bone broth made from ox bones. They give you a HUGE bucket of green onions, and there are also accompanying rice, kimchi, and radish kimchi. This is the best seolleongtang you can get in LA. Nice simple broth with a great selection of meat topping options so you can get whatever you're feeling that day. Add salt to your preference, and you are bound to have a perfect meal on a cold gloomy day.Ambiance: The place was a very mom-and-pop shop. Nothing fancy, but clean and comforting.Service: The waitresses were very nice and quick. Order came out fast since it's basically the only thing on their menu (just with varying toppings).Take-Out Packaging: Styrofoam bowls and plastic bagsSummary: Simply put, if I'm craving seolleongtang, I'm making my way here. My only complaint is the price. I can't quite remember exactly how much it was, but it was almost $20 (plus a potential parking fee). While this dish is a classic, I feel a little hesitant dishing out that much for this dish. Yes, this place has the best seolleongtang, but is a bowl of seolleongtang worth $20? Maybe.

The soup was amazing, one of the best ox-bone soup broths I've ever had and you can truly taste the quality of it.

57,2023-09-06,2023-09-17,Han Bat Sul Lung Tang,"Read about this place from so many articles. Finally had a chance to try it.  Upon arrival, the line was already out the door. But don't let the queue scare you. It moves pretty fast. And the reason for this is because their menu is limited. It's really just one page. No fuss. You sit down, order, and in under 5 minutes, the food is brought out to you. You eat, and then you get out. This is not one of those places you sit around and chat. So if that's the ambiance you are looking for, this is not it.I ordered the tongue and flank. Added lots of green onion and salt to my preference. It was delicious. However, you will not be so full that you would have to undo your pants button. I left with plenty of stomach space for dessert. It's great if you have a hangover or wanting something light. Not so good if you are starving.Parking: Valet parking or park on the street.Line: Please note the queue starts at the back of the restaurant, where the parking lot is. So don't think you got lucky when you open the front door and there isn't a line.","4163 W 5th St Los Angeles, CA 90020",4.4,2754,"Korean, Soup",$$

The waitress goes over the menu then disappears for so long!She recommended the artichokes and squash blossoms. Squash blossoms are ok, a bit salty. Artichokes were awfully overly salted and not good.The pizza was delicious and the oxtail Ragu were the stand out. Carbonara and other pasta dish was also salty.The veal was not good. The cook on it was very uneven and didn't look very appetizing when it came out. The lamb chops were good.Dessert: we got the chocolate torte and ricotta cheesecake. They were out of decaf so no coffee to enjoy with our dessert.There were 2 times when random servers came and dropped off food that wasn't ours. Not sure if this is a common occurrence with other guests.Also, when we were still enjoying our dessert, they asked us to move because they were backed up. I don't think it was our fault that we had to wait to order both our order and our dessert and then they ask us to leave while we were still finishing up dessert.I think this place is more hype. I don't think I would be back.","1545 Wilcox Ave Los Angeles, CA 90028",3.9,644,Italian,$$$$

58,2023-09-11,2023-09-17,Mother Wolf,"Ah, Mother Wolf in Hollywood, the place where dreams of a great wine experience go to die. Picture this: we're there for a work dinner, wallets padded by the company expense account, ready to splurge on some fine wine. We thought, ""Let's get fancy and talk to the sommelier about the vintage differences between some of the older Barolos.""Enter the somm, who seemed as knowledgeable about Barolos as a fish is about mountain climbing. We asked questions, and the answers we got were the verbal equivalent of talking to a used car salesmen bs'ing their way through a pitch. Confidence shattered, we settled for a bottle of Brezza Barolo, which tasted like it was still in its awkward teenage years.The wine list at Mother Wolf is, for lack of a better phrase, a hot mess.

59,2023-09-16,2023-09-17,Perch,"Perch is an LA staple: The type of place that is consistently cited as a destination for tourists, the glitter-on-cheek crowd, Instagram influencers, those trying to land the gig, and those who want to experience the promise of Perch and determine for themselves if Perch merits its august reputation. I fall into the last category, and I can say that Perch fulfills its promise, kind-of, but not really, but at the same time it kind of does, if that makes sense. Like imagine that you have been wanting to taste this cookie and finally you do, and the cookie is everything you hoped it would be but not in the way you expected it to be. So you build up expectations in your head, that the reality of the situation does not deliver. I guess that is the problem with having a robust and notable reputation, you could never live up to it because you can never measure up to a person's imagination.My partner in dine was my friend Carlos, the epitome of a Peter Pan type, old enough to know better, but stubborn enough to remain young at heart. He credits his youthful charm, perspective, and look to his regular visits to the gym and eating right. Note that he did not order the fruit plate of Perch, which means that he is not too strict.I opt for valet. It cost 16.00 dollars. If it it seems high, it is not for downtown LA prices. When we got close, the Valet asked if I could park a car in a nearby spot. I sternly, said no, ""you can park it."" I did feel a certain type of way for being asked to park my own car, even if the spot was close. I go out to be pampered, to be a princess in the world of dining, and quite frankly, a princess does not park her own carriage. Carlos made a joke to the Valet, on how I needed my car parked because I did not know how to park that well. I was annoyed. I stood up for myself, and for that I was the butt of a joke. I paid 16 dollars, I did not want to park my car. Am I right reader? or Am I wrong? Truthfully there is no right or wrong answer. I told Carlos how I felt and it took a cocktail from Perch to my mellow my nerves.The cocktails were not only effective, but tasty. I am someone who does not like to taste alcohol. I informed our server of this fact. I cannot remember their name but they read female to me, so I will be using she/her pronouns to refer to them. I asked our server what recommendation she had for a super sweet drink, she suggested a drink, I cannot remember what it was called but it was pink- fruity for sure, and it had a rim of brown sugar, maybe. It went down sweet-- just like I like my cocktails. This was the cocktail that softened my nerves enough to forget Carlo's blunder of joking with the valet at my expense.Carlos and I started off with the avocado toast. It was solid. I especially appreciated the citrus taste afloat the avocado toast. I also appreciated that the toast was sliced into three slices. I hate when I have to wrestle with my avocado toast; either while cutting it, or when picking it up. I also appreciated that Carlos did not wrestle me when I had two of the slices, and he only 1. Still that did not atone for his faux pa.The rest of the food was simply solid. I had the burger, and the potatoes. He had the classic breakfast: Two eggs, chic ken sausage, and potatoes. He cleaned his plate, he left a small bite of the sausage. I had that small piece before it was taken away by the server. Glad I did--- it was really good sausage!There was a bus-person, she read female to me. She preferred to speak Spanish to me. She had a necklace that was half a heart and half an infinity sign. I asked her, who gave her the lovely gift. She replied her husband with a smile that my heart saw. We shared a moment. She felt it too.As she was cleaning tables, our eyes met and she returned a sincere smile. When I left the joint to go to the Perch Bar, she said in Spanish, thank you for coming, in the most sincere way, like a mother's kiss on her child's cheek- pure love. This is the type of service I expect, customer-centered, sincere, and like I was welcomed guest. Now you see, why I ddid not park my car myself, because that made me feel like I was a number to be processed, and I needed to help in the processing progress of my own turn around the revolving door.Of course, Perch is nestled in the heart of LA. You sit amidst LA's famous skyline. That is why for those who want pictures, go here. Our dining neighbors did. It was two women and one got up three times to take pictures of her partner in dine. Then the server tried her hand at the picture taking. The women did not come together for the server. The same woman who was photographed by her partner in dine, was now being photographed by the server. So, I get that good pictures are important for people, so if pictures are that important for you, come here. But I guess everyone needs to go to Perch to experience its promise and decide for yourself if it was fulfilled or not. Its lofty reputation demands it!","448 S Hill St Los Angeles, CA 90013",4.1,10020,"Lounges, French, Breakfast & Brunch",$$$

We sat at the counter next to the open kitchen in what is a very attractively designed interior. We had charred octopus (tender with a tasty sauce), spicy pomodoro (delicious), sweet corn agnolotti (unique and interesting), and grilled orta fish (perfectly cooked but needs more flavor). Aside from the fish, which would benefit from having a more penetrating sauce instead of or in addition to nesting in a bunch of tiny tomatoes whose flavor doesn't integrate into the fish, all the dishes notably provided tastes that are complex and sophisticated.","4921 W Adams Blvd Los Angeles, CA 90016",4.5,631,"Italian, Mediterranean, Tapas/Small Plates",$$

We called, and they pushed back our reservation. And later the owner (I think) stopped by our table to ask what we were in town for.Our waitress was great and helped make sure everything moved along quickly after we told her we needed to leave in a little over an hour. Our appetizer (a special tomato salad over whipped feta) came out almost immediately and was SO GOOD.I also enjoy my berry+mezcal drink. It was simple but tasty and refreshing. We got the famous spicy pomodoro, and it lived up to the hype. The carbonara was also delicious. I appreciate the noodles themselves.The famous beet spaghetti wasn't available because they're out of season. We'll have to come back for it!We finished the evening with the banana pudding tiramisu (which we've been thinking about for days) and a nice Americano (loved the glass it was served in).When we paid and walked out to hand over our valet ticket, we were surprised to see our car was already being pulled up.

The owner/manager made a weird comment about us not being allowed to take photos when the food came out and if it was meant to be a joke, then it wasn't funny.Five star rating for their spicy pomodoro. I could eat the entire thing without thinking. The shrimp malfadine was too salty. The broccoli bucatini was very good as well. Highly recommend bucatini and pomodoro. I would not get the malfadine again. The shrimp was rubbery. The pea starter with yogurt sauce was delicious with garlic on top.They have issues with pricing on the menu. The starter was 18 on the menu and on the bill it said 22. Same with the malfadine. It was 28 on the menu but 33 on the bill. Then the same owner/manager makes a comment about catching the mistake on his menu but it was like weirdly sketch. luckily they took the pea dish starter off which was kind of them but we left the malfadine since they already took the starter off. Aside from the weird owner's vibe, the staff is attentive and I was surprised about the little detail of storing your leftovers before you leave. I've never been to a restaurant that essentially has a coat check for your leftovers.

60,2023-09-09,2023-09-17,Cento,"And just like that...after one visit to Cento, it's now one of my favorite restaurants in LA.Cento has a beautiful patio, built around a lovely tree, and draped in tiny white lights. The patio has a sandy floor, and it feels like you've been transported to a beachside Italian village. (Or, well, someplace other than the block of West Adams that it shares with an auto repair shop.)The service is exceptional. Attentive but not intrusive, with lots of lovely little touches, like storing your leftovers in their refrigerator until you're ready to leave.The cocktail menu is small and creative. I tried the Espresso & Date martini, with vodka, oat milk, aquafaba and orange, and it was superb--well-balanced and very unique. I also tried a sip (and then possibly three more sips when someone wasn't looking...) of the Fig & Walnut (with Scotch, sweet vermouth and apricot) and it was excellent. I'm excited to return and try the other four cocktails on the menu.Cento's menu is pretty seafood-heavy, so as someone who can't eat seafood, I worried that I wouldn't find much to eat. But in fact, I found too much to eat. (See the note about leftovers above.)We started with the Heirloom Radicchio Salad--with dates, pecan, and raspberry vinaigrette--and the presentation was astoundingly beautiful. It tasted even better.  Next up was the Farro Salad with roasted eggplant (that's blended into a sort of baba ghanoush and mixed into the salad), dill crème fraiche and pomegranate, and that was amazing, too. It looked very simple, but the flavors were astounding. I could eat vats of it.Then, it was time for pasta (!!!). We ordered three pastas for the two of us, because we simply couldn't decide (again, reference note about leftovers...). The Bolognese was my favorite--a super comforting dish of ricotta gnocchi in a phenomenal meat sauce. I also loved the Sweet Corn Agnolotti (charred corn, crème fraiche, Old Bay and chervil). Definitely don't miss that one. And finally, the Spicy Pomodoro (which was not very spicy at all, and I'm a spice wimp), because I saw it going to several other tables and had to try it. While it was my least favorite of the three, it was still great.And finally...dessert. DO. NOT. MISS. DESSERT. The Banana Pudding Tiramisu (a combination of things I wouldn't normally be into) was one of the best desserts I've ever had in life. It's their specialty.

I arrived early and saw open street meters in front of the restaurant, but I opted for valet parking which was $15 (+$1 additional charge if paying with credit card). We had drinks at the bar while waiting for the rest of the party. Since we requested outdoor seating, we were eventually led to the patio surrounded by greenery. Our server was humorous and mindful of our dietary restrictions. However, their attentiveness waned as the restaurant got busier.DRINK ORDERED- The Sustainer ($15 - coconut, rum, turmeric, cinnamon, nutmeg). A nice tropical drink with slight sweetness. The warm spices added an unexpected and welcome twist.FOOD ORDERED- Bread + All Four Spreads ($28). We received three varieties of fresh baked bread: a small baguette encrusted with poppy seeds, a chewy bread with sunflower seed topping, and a sourdough with olive oil inside and salted butter on top. My side of the table didn't get a knife... we struggled to tear the loaves with our hands. My least favorite bread was the baguette, since it was mostly hard and dry crust. The other two breads had better texture. While the sourdough had nice flavor, the olive oil didn't really work with the spreads.As for the spreads, I preferred the cheese with salsa macha and honey. Plain butter and salt was solid, but one bread already had ample oil and butter on it. The trout and artichoke dips were okay. Neither tasted much like their namesake though.- Roasted Beet Salad ($18). Warm roasted beets served on spring mix that was lightly dressed with a smoky vinaigrette. The salad was topped with pickled onion and mini toasts. Caramelized Spanish goat cheese contributed tartness and creaminess. I made a little toast with cheese, beets, and onion which tasted excellent.- Asparagus. Each spear was long and thick, cooked through, and retained a snap. The dish was topped with a creamy sauce that tasted fine, but was a bit oily.- Red Curry Mussels ($24). The mussels were just okay: soft, but not exactly flavorful. I liked the Thai-ish coconut milk curry, which had lime and garlic notes. The crusty baguette made more sense here, but it didn't soften in the sauce as I had hoped. It was nevertheless a tasty bite.- Hearth Roasted Mary's Half Chicken ($28). I was pleasantly surprised by the enormous portion of a dark leg quarter, white meat breast, and a wing. The chicken was juicy, and the skin rendered crispy. I enjoyed the spicy piri piri sauce that tasted like red bell pepper. My side salad didn't seem to have dressing on it, but there was enough flavor on the plate to assist.DESSERT ORDERED- Dark Chocolate Cake ($11). The cake looked promising, but unfortunately did not taste chocolatey. The sponge was not too sweet, which balanced the sweetness of the frosting. I appreciated the fresh whipped cream. Chocolate pearls added additional texture, but not much flavor.- Honey Creme Brulee ($12). The creme brulee was a smooth, loose custard pudding with a bruleed sugar crust. The custard had a strong vanilla and bourbon-ish flavor that I'm not sure was intentional. I also couldn't tell what the crumble was. At least the macerated grapefruit was good.","6530 Sunset Blvd Los Angeles, CA 90028",4.4,387,"American (New), Breakfast & Brunch, Bakeries",

61,2023-09-01,2023-09-17,Superba Food + Bread,"Superba is my go-to place in the neighborhood and I really would have loved to give it 5-star, as I previously wanted. Let's face it, the setting of this place is hard to beat. I used to sit on this gorgeous patio way back when it was still Cat&Fiddle, an unassuming British pub with a simple fare and cheap drinks. I won't be able to count times how many first dates I have had on that patio. I was really sad when it closed down. Never got to try The Hearth&Hound as it came around the pandemic, but I was elated to find the patio decorated with lots of trees and festive umbrellas and bougainvillea, the presence of which makes any which place look magical. But back to the food. Most things Superba makes is of good quality, especially the bread and bready things. However, as many many places in the city, the establishment's efforts to cut corners (and even bask on its laurels) becomes noticeable, which is terribly disappointed. Case to the point: I ordered an heirloom tomato and burrata dish, which I assumed would arrive with a sour dough toast. My mistake. But then again the dish said ""burrata"", not traces of burrata, not a promise of burrata, or burrata whisper, however, if you did not read in the menu that the white smear on the tomatoes was burrata, you would definitely miss that reference. Quite disappointing, yes. Further, a second server (not the one that took the order) brought out my Americano, which half spilled on the saucer. Without skipping a beat or turning her head she said passingly, ""Sorry about the spillage"", plop it on the table and continued walking. I was grateful she did not spill it on me because it felt that she would have said the exact same thing and left. Thankfully, seeing that I am taking pictures of the poor state of the coffee, the head waiter told me he would replace it and brought out a to-go coffee cup as if presuming that I wanted to take it to go, which I did not, but I was still grateful to get a hot cup of coffee instead of the lukewarm mess of the coffee that arrived earlier. Just because the service is casual it should not be careless, me thinks, because, you know, in the end, casual or not, you're going to put down 20% of the service charge. Other times I came here there were other small mishaps and imbalances but they kind of faded from my memory already. I really like the place and I want it to try harder to please the customers rather than to cut corners and save a buck.","6530 Sunset Blvd Los Angeles, CA 90028",4.4,387,"American (New), Breakfast & Brunch, Bakeries",
61,2023-08-28,2023-09-17,Superba Food + Bread,"Food was okay, nothing to die for. I got the Double Cheeseburger which was pretty good, but my girlfriend got the rigatoni bolognese which was under cooked (the pasta not the meat). Ambiance was pretty cool it had a good vibe, and patio seating was really nice. The service was nothing spectacular, not great, but also not horrendous. On a scale of 1-10 it'd be a 5. Overall it's a cool restaurant in a cool location, but it seems like it may be a little over hyped. Although side note the french fries that had some pepper which was included with the double Cheeseburger was definitely the best part.","6530 Sunset Blvd Los Angeles, CA 90028",4.4,387,"American (New), Breakfast & Brunch, Bakeries",

But the food - almost completely flavorless! I've never had thai food with such a lack of seasoning or classic thai flavors. Even the ""hot"" sauces on the side were devoid of spice.  The garden rolls were nice and fresh, the peanut sauce was the only aspect with at least some taste - hence a score of 3 - but only for the rolls.","5210 Beverly Blvd Los Angeles, CA 90004",4.8,231,"Asian Fusion, Thai, Vegetarian",$$

It's a mild spicy and next time I would probably ask for more spice, but it was a good pairing with the tom yum.2. TOM YUM: The tom yum was super flavorful and delicious. Perfect amount of salty and sour... might be the best tom yum I've ever had. It reminded me of a similar dish in Vietnamese culture called canh chua. I'm salivating just thinking about it.SERVICE (5/5):Service was good; you order at the counter and they bring it out to you.AMBIENCE (5/5):Lots of plants indoors - makes for a very cute atmosphere.PARKING (3.5/5):It's Larchmont, so.... street parking is either on the main street or on the residential streets a block over.

The fried cauliflower was so light, it was not greasy and the sauce provided was perfect. The Matcha Thai Tea drink was very good.

63,2023-09-16,2023-09-17,Jon & Vinny's Fairfax,"When the warmth and ambiance of a restaurant really hit you, it's a must you write a positive review and this is exactly what I'm doing. My buddies have been raving about JnV's for some time and I had to go and check it out myself. The restaurant itself is very pretty with an open kitchen and chefs that smile once you enter. The Fairfax location is the only one I've been to and it's usually busy with a lively crowd.For food, we definitely gravitated toward the pizzas. My personal favorite was the White Lightning pizza which I absolutely loved and had I not eaten it so quickly, I would've shared a picture of it. We have some mushroom lovers in the group and they also raved about the ""Super Shroom"" pizza which gives a more than generous amount of mushrooms.To finish, we had to order the ricotta cookies which are the definition of a nice petite dessert. It wasn't so petite when my friend decided to order more and ended up eating 16 cookies in 20 minutes. If ricotta cookies are your thing, I'd be sure to call ahead to make sure JnVs has enough ricotta cookies available as we happened to catch them on a lucky day.The last part, which I really want to emphasize is how great the service is. Calling to make a reservation is very easy but the service once you're seated is so above and beyond. Our table was greeted not only by the hosts, bussers and servers, but also happened to meet the chef, manager and GM as well. Service is quick and friendly, always checking to make sure that you have your food and drinks but also having a good time as well.Thanks Jon & Vinny's, we'll see you soon for your pizzas and ricotta cookies very very soon!","412 N Fairfax Ave Los Angeles, CA 90036",3.8,2431,"Italian, Breakfast & Brunch, Pizza",$$

Bruschetta and tiramisu were mid/not notable. Service was great, super attentive as we got checked on by multiple people throughout our meal and made sure our water glasses were always full.

63,2023-08-31,2023-09-17,Jon & Vinny's Fairfax,"Giving it two stars because the food is not worth the price and the service was bizarre.Initially when we arrived, we were told we might not get a table. It was 4PM, they close at 9PM, and when I asked they told me there were only three parties ahead of me. I then asked if they mostly run on reservations, and they told me no that they also do stand by. So in the 15 minutes we waited while trying to figure out if it was worth it to wait and see how long it was going to be, we got a table. So I don't understand why we were told we might not get a table.Then they sat us in a booth that was way too small for five people. My group consisted of three smaller teenagers, if we were average sized people we would have fared worse. I asked if we could please sit somewhere else (there were several empty tables, and no one else was waiting), but I was told no.Then we were told that patrons usually order tapas style. So we all order something with the intention of sharing. This was a mistake, the entrees were way to small and we had to order more food. Again, my group had small people in it, so we don't normally eat a lot and we left hungry.Lastly, the bill was way too high. And on top of the overpriced food, there was an additional 18% gratuity charge that was added onto the bill. I'll never return to this place again. The hassle, the weird vibes, and the price is not worth it for just 'ok' pasta.

They have other dishes besides the Mandu if you're not wanting that as well. The interior was clean and open, the seats are hard and not comfortable but overall the taste experience was really great.

I love the long concrete table that stands in the middle of the space for communal seating. There are booths and standard tables along the walls as well.The food was great and I actually can't wait to come back and have more of what I loved... which is:1. Fried mandu. Get the sampler. My favorites are the shrimp and jalapeno. Non standard, but they were so delicious. They fry the mandus so well - the outside is so crisp and the inside is fully packed with a generous portion of filling.2. Perilla buckwheat noodle. This is such a simple dish, but the perilla flavor was spot on and there was a hint of sweetness that brought out the flavor even more. The noodles are topped with a generous heaping of seaweed. The portion is huge and could be split into two different meals. The noodles themselves are cooked to just the right tenderness. Would definitely order again.3. Cold kimchi noodles. The bowl is GIANT. It's actually deceivingly huge. The broth is delicious, noodles are very chewy, and the kimchi doesn't actually make it too spicy.For two, we ordered the steamed mandu sampler, the fried mandu sampler, and the 2 noodle dishes. Both of us were extremely full and had leftovers to take home.PRO TIP: if you order an entree, you can add 3 mandus to your order for $3. This is a much better deal than ordering one order of 6 mandus for $9.99. And you can pick the type of mandu you want too!

The energy made me just happy to be there.The buckwheat cold noodle (13.99) looks very basic, but it had a balanced flavor that was dynamic and more complex that just using soba broth.  I enjoyed this a lot and surprised by the perfectly cooked noodles.  The perilla oil worked well with the soy and it wasn't too salty.  Thought this was great.The rose Tteokbokki (14.99) is so creamy, perfect chew and includes some bits of fish cake.  My partner wanted his own dish, he loved it so much especially with the cheese.  We're definitely ordering this again.The spicy cold noodle (13.99) was also great, nice kick and good flavor.The wonton noodle (14.99) was interesting, a lot of citrus and was very refreshing.  It was different from what I was expecting, but had nice pieces of shrimp.The Steamed mandu plate (9.99) were okay, ironically my least favorite dish.  The skin was a bit thin and you get only 6 pieces.  They were honestly very standard and not as memorable as the other dishes.Love it.  We always walked passed, but never got a chance to try it.

Mandu is Korean for dumpling, and I ordered the steamed kimchi dumplings along with the cold Kimchi noodles. The cold kimchi noodles were great, and CHD's steamed kimchi dumplings are 2nd to Pao Jao.

All I've got to say is, the MELROSE, the MELROSE, the MELROSE.Pros:- The sandwiches are huge and if you upgrade to a larger size, they add more meat on the same size bread.- it's on a Dutch bread and they use Boar Head Meat. I do wish that the bread was warmed up a little but that's a personal preference- Service is always great, friendly and fast- The interior is mint blue so that's funCons:- Parking may be a little tricky sometimes because it's facing the street so you may find meter parking on the side-- but that's LA for you- The shop is extremely small, so seating is limited but they've got benches in the front (just not ideal in the summer)- Head's up, there's no restroomRegardless of these cons, I'd still give Ghost 5 stars.

Enchant serves Korean fusion food in a stunning Barbiecore space. I went for dinner, and here's what I got:Drinks: Blue Coconut Margarita, Yo-Berry, Elderflower Tonic. The Elderflower Tonic was a little too spirit-forward for me, but I loved the sweet Blue Coconut Margarita and the Yo-Berry which tasted like an adult Danimals in the best way!Crispy Crab and Spicy Tuna: Unique twist on spicy tuna crispy rice but with a crab cake instead of the rice. Well spiced, huge pieces, super delicious.K-Taco Trio: The bulgogi taco was my favorite, would recommend this!Seafood Cioppino Pasta: Pretty average execution of this dish, but loved the fried crab on top.Kim's Kimchi Pasta: My favorite of the mains, spicy and flavorful, but wish there was more bacon.Born to Be Beef and Cheese: I was the most excited for this one going in. Really cool presentation, delicious sauce and potatoes, loved the tableside cheese brûlée and KBBQ-inspired flavors. The fondue could've been creamier and meat could've been more tender, but overall I enjoyed this!Cheesecake: Our slice wasn't fully defrosted when it was served to us, so the inside was still a bit frozen. After letting it sit for a bit, much better! Pretty average cheesecake but this spot isn't known for their desserts.Latte: Nothing to write home about, but a good (and pretty) latte!Overall, Enchant is a promising new restaurant with a creative menu and great drinks.

We wanted grapefruit juice which is one of the juice options, but they came back and said they were out. I wanted a matcha latte, but I didn't want whole milk and I asked for a milk alternative. They said they have oat milk and then they came back and said they don't have any milk alternatives.Kimchi pasta was really good.The avocado toast was weird. Why is there a CHOCOLATE hazelnut spread with avocado & an egg? My friend did not like it. She had to scrape off everything and just eat the toast with nutella.Crab & spicy tuna toast was good. It's small, but pretty filling if you order it for yourself. It's like a take on crispy spicy tuna except the crab replaces the rice.The waitress also took away my drink before I was done without asking. There was a little left, but I guess it was enough for her to assume I was no longer drinking it.","681 S Western Ave Los Angeles, CA 90005",3.7,37,"Asian Fusion, Breakfast & Brunch, Wine Bars",
69,2023-08-28,2023-09-17,Enchant,"This place is a instagram trap.Came here with a reservation Sunday. Place was fully booked. We were promptly seated and our order was taken within 5 minutes. So far so good. But that was the end of the quality experience.We ordered a blue beach and a cocktail. The blue beach (given it's a soda mixed drink) foamed so much it caused a mess on the table. We had zero napkins and tried to flag a server (there were only 3 working) down for about 10 minutes before giving up and just getting up to grab our own. We ordered the spicy pork lettuce cups and the korean fried chicken to split. We got our lettuce cups about 15-20 minutes in. Not bad, just fine, nothing special about it.As my friend and I talk, I notice the general vibe of the restaurant. Many tables were either being ignored or missing items. The table next to us (who was there before we sat down) got one dish (the avocado toast) and seemed to be waiting on other items. From the time I started noticing them, they tried to flag the server to ask about the other dishes (they were told they were on the way) but never came out. The family eventually left 15-20 minutes later, just paying for the avocado toast and left. A while later, a couple came and sat at the table behind that one and waited for I'd say a good 10-15 minutes before their orders were taken (and they looked ready to order: they weren't looking at the menus, they kept trying to eye the waiters). I saw food being brought out to tables but items either going back (as the order was wrong/for another table) or people asking about other items. I noticed a pattern with the dishes being brought out: Fries, avocado toast, panini sandwiches, and seafood spaghetti. I didn't see any other dishes being brought out and weirdly those are also items I am not seeing in any of the review photos or mentioned in reviews except for if the restaurant or a soft opening review posted them. The table behind us had arrived at the same time, received their seafood pasta a little after we had received the cups, and I overheard them ask how much longer for the Donkatsu.At this point, mind you, my friend and I have been chatting this whole time. We've been done with our drinks and appetizer for a good 30-60 minutes now but are wanting to 1) order more drinks and 2) now feeling distracted enough in our conversation to realize we're missing our main dish. We are trying to flag down a server to order more drinks and ask about our order. The table behind us is also trying to flag down a waiter and we smile at each other in acknowledgement about how difficult it is to get their attention. I have never been at a restaurant where the servers actively look the other way. Like they were trying everything they could do not meet our gaze. My friend and I were now realizing we had sat there 1 whole hour without getting our second dish, had noticed the above behavior and patterns mentioned, and realized we're in Ktown, there are sooooo many other places around us with good KFC if that's what we want. So I end up just getting up and going to the bar to ask for a receipt for the items we received and mentioned we never got our fried chicken. The table behind us also gets up to ask for to-go boxes for the pasta and a check for just the pasta and drinks, no donkatsu. We end up leaving and going to Goltong Chicken where we were promptly seated and served within 10 minutes to delicious KFC.The servers are obviously extremely overwhelmed but instead of being honest with patrons (like ""hey, fried dishes will take longer than expected"") or saying they are out of items like previous reviews have mentioned, they are instead letting multiple tables walk out without their full order (without even an apology mind you).TLDR: Good drinks and instagrammable vibes but lot of tables (including our own) walked out because full orders weren't received and horrible service. There are plenty of other Ktown spots for brunch that have good food and service.","681 S Western Ave Los Angeles, CA 90005",3.7,37,"Asian Fusion, Breakfast & Brunch, Wine Bars",

They kept forgetting my chicken panini and when I finally got it, the chicken was over cooked and tough. The fries that came with it were cold and hard. It wasn't worth asking for a new one as my food came last to the table and everyone else had theirs.Hazelnut latte was too sweet and left that kind of unpleasant sugary aftertaste from cheap syrup.Their kimchi pasta is pretty good, but the bread that comes with it was also hard.I wouldn't go back here unless I was specifically in this one area of Koreatown.","681 S Western Ave Los Angeles, CA 90005",3.7,37,"Asian Fusion, Breakfast & Brunch, Wine Bars",

I told the host (short guy with glasses) that we were  here and wouldn't seat us until our whole party was there even though right after we saw other people get seated without a full party. The rest of my party literally came in the middle of our conversation and he was still rude about it. I expressed my concern about how if we have a reservation, we should be accommodated and a table should be ready for us and he responded with ""well what am I supposed to do if people don't leave?"" What is the point of having reservations then? The host overall was very unwelcoming, did not hear a single sorry or hello or thank you.We also ended up having to sit separately since we were a party of 6 and the tables are pretty small. We should have been informed of this beforehand. It's common sense to think that people in a party would want to sit together, so I don't know why they thought that wasn't a problem. Would not recommend coming with a big group.Food was good but it might have been because I was hungry. Food also would have tasted better if we were treated better.","3400 W 8th St Los Angeles, CA 90005",4.4,177,"Korean, Barbeque",

The short host guy with glasses and white dress shirt said where's our whole party and we were all there already. He said we would need to wait a little longer. What is ridiculous is we saw plenty of parties without their full party be seated, but our whole party was present when we arrived. He said he was waiting for a party to leave. If we have a reservation, the table should've been ready. We were waiting for over 30 min even though we had a reservation. They also said we would be split up into 2 tables when there's 6 of us. Wanted to eat here bc of the good reviews and because Jungkook recommended, but the type of service we got from the host was very rude.We opted for the2 large pork gyus for 6 people, which the server recommended. The food itself was very good, our server could've been more interactive but she was split between at least 6 other tables. Many times we would have to flip the meat ourselves or take it off before it started to overcook, but she was very busy so it's understandable.","3400 W 8th St Los Angeles, CA 90005",4.4,177,"Korean, Barbeque",

The sides include wagyu carpaccio, steamed egg, hangover ramen, and kimchi fried rice. The service is spectacular as they cook the meat for you so you can focus on eating and hanging out with friends. All the meats are top-notch, but my personal favorite was the pork cheek. I wish the short rib came marinated but the yellow dipping sauce is exquisite and goes well with any meat.

They mix it in front of you and I appreciate that they ask how much of the spicy mayo you want in it. The pickled radish bits add just another level to the texture I loved.The spicy tan tan ramen was solid. A bit spicy for me if I was going to have the whole bowl to myself. I'm eager to go back to try their other ramens because I loved the texture of the noodles and the thinly sliced pork.The kimchi mushroom was delicious, packed a good amount of heat. A bit expensive for the amount given.Unagi rice roll had a nice smoky flavor. I think something was missing flavor wise.For desert we got the mango shaved ice. The topping of honey cream was so so so good and the texture of the shaved ice was nice and soft. Sadly, the mango inside was not sweet at all.The orange sake highball and paper plane were pretty good. I had wanted to get a skin contact wine and they were nice enough to offer a taste of it and thank goodness they did because I did not enjoy it at all. Ended up getting a different drink.Ambience was a 10/10. Service was inconsistent and on the slow side but everyone was really nice. We were able to find parking in the neighborhoods.

The Guanciale bits are crisp and salty and really balance well with the creamy smooth cheese.Burrata. 5/5 Another winner with a flavor pop in each bite from the castelvetrano olives,The crusts of the pizzas are less crisp than some other Neapolitan pizzas and more airy and soft... reminiscent of a perfectly executed naan.Pastas.Squid ink spaghetti with crab. 4/5 Tender morsels of crab with very al dente thin spaghetti in a slightly briny sauce. Very balanced and flavorful.Ricotta gnocchi. 3/5 Perfectly textured gnocchi with a tomato sauce that you dip into their super creamy Burrata. The flavor reminded me of chef boyardee in only the best and most nostalgic way.Desserts:Chiffon cake with seared plums, nectarines and crème fraiche. 4/5 Delightfully light.Chocolate budino tart. 4/5 Well-balanced chocolate with salted caramel that isn't too sweet or overpowering.Service 5/5Cost/value 3/5. Very expensive but worth it for a special treat.Overall 4/5. Would definitely return for just the drinks and pizzas.","2121 E 7th Pl Los Angeles, CA 90021",4.3,7486,"Italian, Cocktail Bars, Pizza",$$$

Tonight we went and had the absolute WORST server of all time (coming from someone who worked the service industry). Her name was Berenice and she took 20 minutes to touch out table. She was not apologetic. Second, we ask her for recommendations and she simply picks out the most expensive things on the menu. She literally walked away mid order to give someone else the bill. She constantly forgot dishes and my moms wine. She gave horrible food descriptions and told us we had a perfect amount of food when we significantly over ordered. I am so appalled by the treatment and service of this woman. I hope to not see her there again.","2121 E 7th Pl Los Angeles, CA 90021",4.3,7486,"Italian, Cocktail Bars, Pizza",$$$

I was shocked when my $38 pasta dish had around 20 pieces of tiny, .75 inch ravioli. Sadly, Bestia is the kind of restaurant where you spend $200 on food only to pickup Chipotle on the way home.The drink I ordered, the old fashioned, was a $19 bland liquid with a weak pour.At the end, the bill includes a 4% ""service charge"" that isn't a tip.The bill also lies about the subtotal. They add the service charge and tax BEFORE asking you to tip. It's a subtle, scummy way to get you to overtip.Parking is a nightmare unless you pay for $12 valet.If money is no object, give Bestia a try!

Not only their seasoning and flavor were on spot, but the pan fried bottom of the dumplings made it much easier (and tastier) to enjoy the soup filling.We also ordered their fancier truffle dumplings. They're not cheap, but they absolutely are worth the price, as they do not skimp on the truffle flavor.And their chocolate buns are huge and delicious!And the staff was extremely nice, kind and attentive to my family, including my 3-year-old. Some of the nicest staff I've seen in a while!The place is quite small inside, though. So plan accordingly.

75,2023-09-14,2023-09-17,Cara Cara,"It's only proper for me and my friend to dine at a rooftop bar in the heart of LA. We're both ones to soak in remarkable views, indulge in delectable bites and delicious drinks, and bask in the company of others. I wanted to celebrate a special day with my thoughtful friend, Terry K., who selected Cara Cara for us to dine at.Reservations are required to enter Cara Cara's rooftop oasis. The view of downtown Los Angeles is impeccable whether it's basking in the afternoon daylight, enjoying golden hour, or dining among the moonlight. My friend made reservations at noon on a weekday and it got busy as our meal progressed. With the restaurant situated on the penthouse floor there's a few tables inside and along the bar as well as a vast patio. I recommend dining on the patio. There are plenty of cushioned tables for pairs or larger groups. Surrounded by lush plants, stylish furniture and decor, and a swanky open air ambiance--what's not to gush over? All staff who assisted us were warm and welcoming. The waitress made sure to ask about any allergies and checked in on us throughout our experience.Our waitress mentioned that the restaurant's food is best shared; so that's exactly what we did! We grazed upon French Fries and Mini Lobster Rolls. Fries are hard to mess up in my opinion. There's were good and crispy, loved the aioli and perfect to snack on. Lobster rolls were citrusy, the lobster was firmer and mild, the roll was crunchy too. My roll was heavily dressed which caused it to break in half due to being soggy. It was great to try but I'd order something different if I were to come back.If you're looking for a different view of LA, try visiting Cara Cara. This is a hot spot for friends, date nights, or groups! It's a popular spot with a scenic skyline and a relaxing ambiance. Plenty of food and drinks to go around with efficient service making it a fun time. You won't regret it and I'm elated to have made memories with my dear friend here.

There's metered street parking which is a free after a certain time, but I'm sure a lot of people know that already so good luck. Right next to the Proper are two lots. My friend chose the smaller of the two, and cheaper. $10. I saw valet in front but don't know how much. Didn't ask.Don't know if you need a reservation (we did) however, you have to be let up by an attendant on the ground floor to head up to the roof. Guess you can ask if drop in is available. Best to call ahead though. Would suck to pay for parking and find out there's no tables available.Service was great. Aside of being presented the bill before we ordered the main course - which was partly our fault - we ordered one course at a time. Drinks. Then appetizers. Then drinks. Our server probably thought we were done. Back to the service - he and his team were attentive and friendly. Even as it started to get packed, they were on it.Then there was the food and drinks. Drinks were great. Not watered down. A little on the strong side but no complaints from me. It wasn't so bad that it was all alcohol. Pretty balanced I'd say. Just be prepared for the price point. Not so bad but definitely not dive bar rates.And the food. Comes out quick. That's not why we ordered one course at a time. We just didn't know what we wanted. But see pics. Started off with appetizers and finished up with the Steak Frites. A little on the high side for the portion size but the experience, taste and views made up for it.I'd come back again for the vibe and views.","1100 S Broadway Los Angeles, CA 90015",3.9,503,"American (New), Cocktail Bars",

My friends and I ordered the Uni cream pasta and the bacon, eggplant, mozzarella pasta. The tomato based pasta was deliciously smokey and the pasta was cooked al dente, it was truly a dish to rave about. The Uni pasta was slightly less exciting, while the pasta and sauce was delicious, the single piece of uni threw me off. It was warm and very pungent, the dish could have done without it. Maybe it's just me and I don't like warm uni, but it was a strange experience. That said, the uni pasta was still my favorite because the sauce was just splendid.

Service was curt and a bit rushed, because I think I'd arrived near closing time and was part of their last batch of customers.If you order a pasta, you're served with a basic white bread roll with a pad of butter, as well as a side salad with a typical vinaigrette. The seafood pasta wasn't anything to write home about, I mean it was delicious but I think I could honestly make it at home. The mentai pasta had a great creamy, umami flavor from the butter and mushrooms that I enjoyed, however I don't think I'd be able to have the entire dish as it'd get too rich.I don't really like the ambiance here because I prefer less bustling restaurants, and because you're seated so closely next to others, other parties can hear your conversations relatively easily so just be mindful of that. If you're looking for an intimate date spot, I would not recommend this establishment. It's good for what it is, but I've had better!","432 E 2nd St Los Angeles, CA 90012",4.4,1259,"Italian, Japanese",$$

For pasta, we ordered the Uni Pasta and Beef Ragu Sauce Spaghetti.I thought the Uni Pasta would be my favorite, but I enjoyed the Beef Ragu so much more which is saying a lot because I typically don't like red sauce pastas!!!The ambiance is very cozy and the service is great and friendly.

78,2023-09-16,2023-09-17,Lolo,"Food:The food was absolutely delicious. The hummus with roasted grapes and nuts had a smooth and rich flavor that was incredibly satisfying. The only downside was that the two slices of bread provided were not enough to finish all the hummus. However, the bread with honey and butter is a must-have! incredibly delicious. Another standout dish was the Cacio e Pepe, which although on the smaller side, was definitely worth it.Service:The service was excellent. Our server was highly attentive and on top of everything. They constantly refilled our water glasses and checked on our table regularly. However, the wine director could use some improvement as we ended up receiving the wrong bottle of wine at our table, and was not too helpful when we were trying to decide which bottle to get.Ambiance:The ambiance of the place was simply perfect, making it an ideal spot for a date night. We were seated outside, which provided a more quiet and intimate atmosphere. Inside, they had different seating setups, including couches and a smaller bar where people were standing.Overall, it was a fantastic experience with delicious food and an amazing ambiance.

78,2023-07-21,2023-09-17,Lolo,"First of all, when we walked in the staff, seemed extremely annoyed that anybody was there at five minutes after opening. The olives and bread were amazing.I've been to multiple places around LA and never seen a scoop of Burrata TOSSED on a plate with huge pieces of peach on top. I must say the peaches were perfect!  it was just not worth the money. The sashimi as you can see was cut horribly and looked disgusting , unfortunately I did not take a picture before sharing, but this is the worst cut I've ever seen in my life. Think of an amateur cutting sashimi with a steak knife and having to pay full price. Not only was the service extremely disappointing we felt very unwanted in this place.Unfortunately, a lot of places that automatically charge gratuity just don't care how they treat you.Honestly, there's so many other places in Echo Park, that are so much better.","5140 W Sunset Blvd Los Angeles, CA 90027",4.1,110,"Wine Bars, American (New)",

78,2023-06-22,2023-09-17,Lolo,"Gorgeous wine bar with great food!-- Atmosphere --The parking is a little tough during the weekdays / traffic hours but you can find meter parking by Shakeys and walk a block. You need to walk through a black gate that's generally closed to enter the venue. Trust me, the inside is beautiful.This place is great for 2-4 people, there are small round tables for smaller groups but there's also a lounge area for larger groups.They have wine fridges in the back with a friendly Sommelier, she was super helpful and attentive when I was picking out the wine.-- The Wine --They have a great selection of wine bottles and wine by the glass that range in different types (Sparkling, Orange, etc). Their wines range between $16-$18 by the glass, you can also get a bottle of wine to open (though there's corkage fee, this is standard).I ordered their sparkling on the menu and it was delicious, super refreshing and super unique, it was a natural wine. Everyone else at my table was pretty happy with their selections as well.-- The Food --The menu there is made for shared / family style. We ordered:- 3 Appetizers to start, they were all very delicious but the memorable ones were theCrudo with Cherries (it wasn't fishy at all, the sweetness & crunch toppings really made this special)Burrata with Tomatoes (the burrata was fluffy and a completely different texture than what I'm used to, and it was absolutely amazing. It was lightly sweetened with honey & balsamic, and the tomatoes they used were to die for).- For the greens, we ordered the Zucchini and while it was delicious, I wished we also had ordered the Little Gem Salad. If you're a veggie eater, I would recommend ordering more here- For the main, we got a single dish of the mushroom pasta. It definitely was not filling for 4 people and we should've gotten at least another 1-2 mains.Overall, it was a great experience, food was great but you'd need to order a lot to really get full. Wine selection is amazing.","5140 W Sunset Blvd Los Angeles, CA 90027",4.1,110,"Wine Bars, American (New)",

Took patio seating at a 5pm reservation, roof was opened about 10 minutes in and it was lovely to eat semi Al fresco. The agnolotti was so delicious it barely sat on my plate for more than 3 minutes. The crème brûlée, though not traditional in presentation still had every element you look for in a creme brûlée and the sorbet on top paired very well. The music was low enough to speak over and the decor was elegant without being gaudy. Variety of people , couples, colleagues, friends, family, you and old and everyone was enjoying their meal it seemed.

82,2023-09-08,2023-09-17,Providence,"Where can I start, best food I've ever had! We went for my birthday and staff were very friendly. For our first course we got wagyu and it was great.","5955 Melrose Ave Los Angeles, CA 90038",4.4,2942,"American (New), Seafood",$$$$
82,2023-09-08,2023-09-17,Providence,"If you're reading this review one of your main questions is: is it worth it? First, each meal is about $300. The wine pairing is about $150. Then, there are the upgrades. Tax. And tip. So if you do the simple addition you can see you'll spend a lot of money on your meal. So is it worth it? Well, let me say it is by far the most I have ever spent on one meal. By far! So go in with your eyes open. But was it worth it? Unequivocally yes! It's not just the food it's the experience. If you watch The Bear you know that restaurants like Providence seek to give you a full experience because they know you're spending a lot of money. The food alone was excellent. Starting with the amuse bouche which was so good I didn't know how they would top it. But they did. Each course explained. The servers seamlessly tagged teamed our dining experience. I don't drink so while my wife had her wine pairings they were kind enough to set up mocktail pairings for me, which I don't think they'd done before. There were certain food I didn't care for. I went with most of it but they were really clear that they want you to so speak up and ask for what you need and want. (But don't be a d$@& about it ) As one of our servers said, ""Here, we want you to say something. Always say something. It is not your job to fit into our experience. It is our job to fit into your experience."" As someone who has been called high maintenance that was honestly really nice to hear. Everything was good. You get to take your time enjoying the meal and enjoying your company. It was our twenty year anniversary and it was a great way to begin to celebrate it! And here is the cherry on top: I forgot my business card there. At first they couldn't find it but Sarah looked a second time after we looked everywhere and she found it tucked into the bottom of the bill holder. That alone was above and beyond. But then they did not simply say come get when you can they asked where I lived and checked to see if someone might be able to drop it off! Drop it off at my house. Are you kidding me? Well, they did. It would have been a two hour trip with traffic for me to get it and I was leaving for business the next day. Who does that? Providence does. So if you want to have a special experience with amazing food and are willing to invest in it I highly recommend giving yourself the gift of Providence, at least once.","5955 Melrose Ave Los Angeles, CA 90038",4.4,2942,"American (New), Seafood",$$$$
82,2023-09-01,2023-09-17,Providence,"Providence was a very solid dinner experience with friendly and knowledgeable servers. The restaurant is fairly dark inside but each table has its own lamp, which adds a very intimate vibe. We found free street parking near the dmv about a block away but there is valet parking available too.We started the meal with two cocktails. I forgot what they were, but one had watermelon and the other had honey from the beehive on the second floor. Both were good and not too sweet. From the add-ons, we got uni egg with caviar which was a bit salty (most likely due to the caviar) but delicious, along with the rabbit tortellini which was good but could use some more flavor.For the main dinner menu, the amuse bouche was a great start with shiso wrapped tuna and several other small bites. We both loved the shima aji, but everything else lacked a similar wow factor. However, we both did not like the bread service. Compared to some other fine dining restaurants, the crust here was very hard to chew and might poke the inside of your mouth if you try to bite off the corner so be wary of that.We got the swordfish and the duck for the entrees. The swordfish was soft but didn't have a whole lot of flavor, but this was also my first time eating swordfish so I don't have anything to compare it with. However, we've eaten duck multiple times and the one here was good but not great. It was cooked well but the sauce could also use more flavor and salt.Onto dessert, the mango one was like a sorbet and tasted really good. Very fresh and flavorful mango. The chocolate dessert tasted somewhat like haagan daz which is a good thing, but needed more of the ice cream to balance out the chocolate. Then finally, there were a couple small bites and sweet coffee  to end the night.","5955 Melrose Ave Los Angeles, CA 90038",4.4,2942,"American (New), Seafood",$$$$
82,2023-08-28,2023-09-17,Providence,"This place is hands down the most interesting culinary experience I've ever had. I was skeptical about the small portions of the food for the Michelin star prices, but the very first bite I had...it was such a burst of delicious flavors and it made sense. And it just kept coming and coming. We got the tasting menu and drinks from reserve. It was absolutely delicious. Everything was so perfectly curated and the vibe of the place was cool - it's soft and quiet. Haven't had many other Michelin star restaurants in LA, but this one deserves all of the hype.

83,2023-09-09,2023-09-17,Openaire,"I gave them a credit card to make a reservation for eight people for breakfast. We were seated in the greenhouse. It was a warm day and everyone was dressed in light clothing but the greenhouse was over airconditioned. I heard someone in another party say ""It's chilly in here!""We ordered breakfast and my plain black coffee took a long time to arrive. When it finally came ($ 7.00!), it was barely lukewarm. I told the wait person and after a long time, I received what I believe was the same coffee that had been heated in a microwave. Most of the food was pretty good but not worth the exorbitant price.When we received the bill, we gave them two credit cards and told them to split it in half. A few days later, I looked online and saw that I had been charged the total amount. My niece told me that she was charged half. I called them and a rather nasty man answered and said he couldn't trace it unless someone returned to the restaurant with a receipt. I filed a claim with my credit card company and the restaurant withdrew the charge on my niece's card, instead of charging me half. I wound up being charged for the whole bill while my niece reimbursed me with Venmo. Very annoying!

It has a gorgeous ambience with the greenery and I love how the pool is right outside. However, everything else was terrible.I made a reservation on OpenTable for 1:15pm and we arrived around 1pm. They kept telling us our table would be ready about 4 times and we were finally seated at 1:45pm. It took 15minutes for the server to give menus. Everything just went downhill. We even ordered drinks at the pool since the server was taking forever to get our order. The server finally took our order...The food was NOT good, we all ordered rice bowls and all my friends said it was salty and unappetizing. It was not an enjoyable meal, nobody finished their food. The frozen drinks at the pool were good and I also ordered the midnight margarita which was good too.I'm not sure if the food is better during breakfast or dinner, but the lunch was unappetizing. Overall, 1 star for the pretty ambience other than that I have nothing good to say about Openaire.

Wonderful, delicious food, but service when we went was pretty mediocre and ambiance was just okay.Every single dish we tried though was delicious and we were impressed by the quality and execution. Especially loved the lobster kebab (so unique and great flavor) and the beef kebab and beef shislik. The kebab was visually more the traditional beef kebab you'd expect but the quality was more like a high grade steak and so juicy and yummy. The shislik was made from ground beef and heavily seasoned in the best way and had a unique flavor. The two contrasted each other nicely, and we loved the laffa (super fluffy but chewy) and the sauces that were served alongside the meat.

I was kinda looking forward to getting a glass too, but we were the only ones waiting without a glass...

The person who checked in on us wasn't even our server. After she left, one of the bussers finally brought us water... 5 minutes later, we left. And the person who checked in on us earlier apologized to us and totally understood why we left. She was nice and offered us a free bottle of champagne if we decided to stay, but at this point I was just furious and hungry and on a time crunch so we left. I wanted to give my girl a nice dinner and make her day special because she was soooo stoked for the concert. I was so disappointed especially because I used to work at a restaurant during college.

However this trip we (Jonas Brothers Concert) we made the decision to meet here with the group we were going to the concert with. The food was quite tasty! I had the double smash burger (not pictured) and it was very well made and I finished it extremely quick even for my standards! My wife ordered the Spaghetti and gave me a little bite, I have to say the lemon that is used in the dish makes this spaghetti quite a dish. It was a flavor I have not had before.Both drinks my wife and I got (The Watermelon Drink - wife) and the (espresso martini - myself) were very good.My wife's drink was very good, it was a type of slushy and had tons of flavor. The espresso martini also was very good, I make it a point to try an espresso martini at just about every restaurant that has one. The ingredients intrigued me as i believe this is made with Kahlúa but it is not overly sweet but the right amount to still taste good with your burger or pasta.The next time my wife and I are in the area we will be stopping by for drinks. Joey's is a bit expensive so just make sure going in that it is on the pricier side.

We sat at the bar & were  greeted  by the nicest bartender. I had a glass of the chilled red & my husband had an old fashioned. To eat we tried the jollof arancini (absolutely delicious, this is a MUST), the palm bisque (also great, loved the mushroom) & grits (these had more of a couscous consistency & tasted great). To finish we had their version of beignets (puff puff bread) which came with a ginger habanero chutney-very unique! I just wish they had some hot sauce bc I like a little kick, but nothing lacked in flavor.I love that Ubuntu uses real ingredients, no processed meat. The food tastes fresh, light,& delicious. I'll be back!","7469 Melrose Ave Los Angeles, CA 90046",4.7,9,"Vegan, African",
86,2023-08-27,2023-09-17,Ubuntu,The food was delicious. We basically had one of everything on the menu. Our impression was that it's a pretty new restaurant and they were going through some growing pains in terms of efficiency. The servers were very nice but we had two separate servers and that made the made things a little less seamless and slow. The indoor and outdoor setting was cool and west African music was authentic. I'd go back and highly recommend the okra passion fruit dish and the trumpet mushrooms. Definitely avoid the rice - it was overpriced for a tiny portion and tastes very bland.,"7469 Melrose Ave Los Angeles, CA 90046",4.7,9,"Vegan, African",
86,2023-08-20,2023-09-17,Ubuntu,"Tried Ubuntu in a group of 4 for a celebratory dinner and had a wonderful experience. We all left full and happy, will definitely be coming back!The food is meant to be shared family style with a recommendation of 2-3 plates per person. We ordered one of each food menu item and our favorites were:- Jollof arancini - well-seasoned, perfectly fried and the sauce on top was so delicious, we got a second order- Grilled cabbage - smoky, savory- Fonio grits - love they use Old Bay with mushrooms- Palm bisque - it's got some great heat- Lion's mane pie - perfect crust and yummy fillingWe also enjoyed all the other dishes, the only one that was a miss was the SUYA. I love celery root and was looking forward to this dish. Unfortunately it didn't come together for any of us. The celery root was grilled perfectly but wasn't seasoned enough, the tzatziki seemed like an after thought - not much of it and also wasn't well seasoned - and we didn't get where the tomato confit was (ours was served with fresh micro greens, red onion and tomato). Great concept, I hope they work out the execution of it bc I'd love to try an improved version of this dish.Both desserts were delicious. The plantain cardamom tart was served warm and gobbled up quickly. The puff puffs were fried to perfection but the chutney was a tad savory for a dessert course, and that generally seemed to be the consensus - we left a bunch on the plate.Not taking a star off for any of the slight misses, bc we had a great experience overall.They have a full service bar with wine, beer, and a great cocktail and mocktail menu. We each got a cocktail or mocktail and it's so nice to have a yummy grown up drink for anyone who doesn't want to drink for personal reasons. I got the viridescence and would recommend as a light summer refresher :)The decor is beautiful with trees and overhead lights on the patio, and inside fiddle leaf figs, plush banquets, etc. A nice place to dress up a bit and go have fun.The service was warm and attentive from upon arrival until we left. Several of us were running a few minutes late, they didn't guilt trip us and sat us as we arrived, ensuring each person got water and drink orders started. They were kind and attentive throughout and showed genuine appreciation for our patronage. They even initiated an offer to take a group photo for us which we appreciated!Parking was easy - my partner and I found street parking on Melrose, our friends got valet ($10). Again, they don't make you wait for the whole group to arrive to seat you, so you can have someone look for parking while others get seated and order drinks if you prefer to save on valet.","7469 Melrose Ave Los Angeles, CA 90046",4.7,9,"Vegan, African",
86,2023-08-13,2023-09-17,Ubuntu,"Overall, ambience was super cute. We loved the customer service and most dishes were tasty. But one issue I would say that came from our visit tonight was food portion. We ordered 6 dishes for the night. Now I get that this is a more upscale restaurant but the portion size was extremely small. So if you come know you probably won't get full. The entrees are the size of appetizers. It felt like everything was tapas basically. I was really taken a back by the grits dish. Considering this is usually a hearty dish, I was thrown off by what we received. It looked like we had a scoop of grits smushed down to the shape of the bowl they came in with a few mushrooms and raw tomatoes with a bit of a sauce. Considering that grits are such a cheap dish, one would at least think that you'd have enough to share with the table. The rice and black eye peas portion also very small to share.  Lastly, we loved the Lions Mane pie. But when you realize you paid $14 for a small one it makes you question what you're doing. The Jollof arancini was tasty very diff than jollof but was really good. My friends ordered the non-alcoholic hibiscus drink. They loved it. Mine I ordered the gin drink called Nyaniba but it tasted like it was also non-alcoholic. Was tasty if it were a drink without alcohol. If you have money to burn to taste appetizers I'd say this is def a cool spot to try but honestly if you thought you were going to get more of the filling West African food with a vegan spin, you're not going to get that here.","7469 Melrose Ave Los Angeles, CA 90046",4.7,9,"Vegan, African",

The potatoes were (and every single one of us stated) the best potatoes that we have ever had. They truly just melted in your mouth, and we all said we would go back just for those potatoes.

There were so much meat and veggies in the soup and it went great with rice! It gave me such a homey feeling. Definitely would recommend this!The seok pork spare ribs were very good too! The marinade they used wasn't overly sweet and it was just super delicious! But they do put this on a portable stove at your table so it keeps cooking. The meat may get a bit tough later if you don't turn off the stove.I read an article saying that Lee Ga makes their own naengmyeon noodles. They even have a machine that makes it, which is one of the reasons we got it. The noodles were great -- texture is chewy and bouncy. I feel like the broth was a bit under seasoned? There wasn't much flavor to it and the broth wasn't icy. Maybe it's because we had the gukbap first and the gukbap had so much flavor that the naengmyeon seemed bland.The kimchi dumplings were pretty dry though. I didn't enjoy those as much.Overall, it was a very good meal.

Dumplings were lacking in flavor, the filling was watery and bland, and did not hold together very well. The oxtail soup, oh man, delicious and enough for 2 people. The broth was rich but not greasy at all, the kimchi was perfect for it soup. Service was good even for being so busy. A little difficult to find seating for more than 4 people, we did have to wait quite some time even though the lunch rush was over. No big deal because the naengmyun was worth it.

We have been here three times so far and will definitely visit again when we can. Their food is always amazing and fresh. And their service is always exceptional, making us feel very welcomed. Interesting decor, kinda a mix of our kind of quirkiness with robot figures and toys, plus techno or house music. They got a cool DJ booth, too, definitely has the potential to be a great event space.Our repeat order:KBBQ Chicken - Super crispy and juicy fried chicken coated with a delicious sweet and savory sauce. Portion is pretty much about a whole chicken! The breading they used tasted like sweet potato, which I love. 10/10Other things we're tried:Ginja Odengtang, added beef tendon and boiled egg - perfectly seasoned dashi broth soup with fish cakes for late night or cold weather comfort. The beef tendon was very tasty! It comes with a side of house-made pickled daikon, carrot and pickle. And again, the portion is great. It can probably feed 3-4 people. 10/10Johnson Tang (Korean Army Stew), added ramen - yum yum yum! The soup stock is so flavorful! Lots of sausages, ham, kimchi, onion, and topped with cheese. They pre-cooked the ramen to perfection, and put it on a large separate bowl for us so we can dig right in without waiting for the ramen to cook. Whatever sauce they made for the stock is amazing, adding a nice depth to the flavor. Great portion size as usual. 10/10Pork Belly Bossam - tender pork belly slices, yet again perfectly seasoned and great portion size. Love love love the stir-fried kimchi side 10/10House Smoked Salmon Plate - thick slices of smoked salmon topped with shaved lemon peel, diced onion, capers, fresh lemon slices, and a house made dipping sauce. Very yummy! The shaved lemon peel is a very very nice touch. 10/10Karaage Salad - very crispy and juicy fried chicken pieces and salad with a yummy ginger-ish dressing 10/10+ an assortment of beer and liquor, plus delicious soju highball mixed drinks.++ sometimes they give us a side of thin, sweet potato friesIdk, we just love this neighborhood place so much.

93,2023-09-06,2023-09-17,Yup Dduk LA,"I've been wanting to come here for a couple years or so now. First time I'd heard of this place the line was out the door and long so my friends and I ended up at a different restaurant in the same plaza. Since then, every time I pass through town and research Yelp for yummy places to eat, this one seems to keep popping up. But then, I'm usually alone and it seemed like too much food for one. Boy was I right!We were a party of three this time. It was close to 8pm on a Tuesday night so the wait was maybe 15-20 minutes. After reviewing the menu, I realized this menu did not offer diet food. There were no fresh vegetables in their offerings. Sometimes, you just need an indulging meal.The space is quite small. Depending on the table configurations there were a maximum of 4-5 table sets possible. But this tinyness of the space added to the charm. People came in and out to grab takeout while all the tables were filled. It amused me that all the customers at the time of our visit were probably all under the age of 25, except us.And then I saw all their bowls of Tteokbokki on their tables. They weren't regular bowls, they were GIANT bowls full of sticky noodles covered in spicy gochujang style red sauces, covered in gooey cheese. We ordered Yup Dduk, Set C. In our order there was yam noodles (the kind Japchae is made of), fried onion rings and fried zucchini, fish cake, a couple small pieces of sausage and maybe some other things. Being an ""older customer"" my body can't necessarily handle such a carb loaded meal. But, my eyes and taste buds feasted on this dish! It was delish! I think this bowl could have fed 6 people! We had plenty of leftovers. On the side, the only vegetable to be considered was pickled radish. Does that count as ""balance""?One of my favorite things about the meal was making seaweed covered rice balls. I'd never done this before. So much fun and delicious too. I'll be trying this at home!And when they advise ""extra mild"", I recommend you take their suggestion. No shame in extra mild.I can handle a decent amount of slickness. No joke! This was spicy! It definitely inched to my borderline.","3603 W 6th St Los Angeles, CA 90020",4.5,2396,"Korean, Chicken Shop",$$

We ordered the extra mild and it was still quite spicy for us, but was still really good. The location was a little small, but we went on a weekend around noon so we were able to be seated right away.We also ordered some yogurt drinks on the side, but they were a little small and not sure if I would have them again other than for the fact that it helped calm down the spice.Would definitely go back next time I come down to LA!","3603 W 6th St Los Angeles, CA 90020",4.5,2396,"Korean, Chicken Shop",$$
93,2023-09-01,2023-09-17,Yup Dduk LA,"Great place to grab a bite with your friends when in K-Town. The location is quite small though with only a few tables and limited parking. Something to consider if you are craving rice cakes (ddukbokgi/tteokbokki).I came here with a group of 4 and we were able to fit perfectly by combining two tables. We split two bowls of rice cakes. In hindsight, one bowl would have been sufficient. The portion sizes here are really big! Also beware of the spiciness levels. I am pretty comfortable with spiciness and the mild was too spicy for me. If this is your first time here, I'd recommend to start with extra mild and then work your way up the spiciness ladder.","3603 W 6th St Los Angeles, CA 90020",4.5,2396,"Korean, Chicken Shop",$$

We came here at 4:30pm on a Sunday and was surprised that there was a wait - but after 15 min nearly everyone left the restaurant so 5pm is the ideal time to visit LOLWe ordered their standard with fried spam and ramen at mild spicy. Don't take their spice level for granted though - I love spicy food and eat it a lot but their mild was definitely more of a medium. For two people, this is definitely enough and more for another takeaway meal. I would highly suggest getting other things to help with the spice levels like banana milk and rice balls just to cut the meal - I didn't need it but my friend definitely did LOLIf you add a lot of sides, the bill will rack up but I found out meal to be the perfect amount! May opt for more cheese next time!Parking: valet during the time we went at $3 which isn't too bad.Restaurant size: slightly smaller which is why there was a wait.

I had been hesitant after looking at the menu because their tacos seemed kind of pricey, but now I see they're worth EVERY penny. They're a pretty big bang for your buck!! I LOVED the braised beef and the swordfish taco melted in my mouth. But I will say surprisingly their frijoles side was my fave item.. wow. Zesty flavor and I could have JUST had a bowl of that and walked away saying ""that was one of the best dishes in Los Feliz"". The fingerling potatoes were great too.

We decided to start Mr. Wanderlust for appetizers and pre dinner cocktails with our server Julia who went above and beyond, this is the most beautiful library with the most amazing collection of books and artifacts from all over the world. They have live music and like anything else from the Houston Brothers a aerialist performance which remind me of my first time at Pour Vous, the library is plush with plenty of space to gather with friends. Next, we had our host walk us through a secret door to Golden Hour, this is the carrousel outdoor bar which is simply beautiful with cabanas and the most amazing views of the sunset. We had an aperitif at the carrousel where Josh help us with our concoction's, which were on point delicious. Now is time to walk over to Maison Kasai for our dinner, we got greeted and seated by the marvelous twins (sorry ladies I forgot your names, but not your service which was excellent). We all decided on the the Red Snapper teppanyaki which is a must, the first course is a black sesame tofu which was very unique and delicious. Overall my experience at Level 8 has been out of this world, make sure you come with ample time to enjoy every single experience as each is very unique, by the way the Cocomelon cocktail was one of my favorites.

She was raving about all of the sushi she and her boyfriend had eaten two nights ago. We had several sushi including Hamachi Negi & Truffle, Crispy Soft shell Crab, Double Dragon roll and a few more that I can't remember alongside cold sake and Sapporo! I typically take pics of all of my food but we were so darn hungry that we couldn't wait...lol! Each sushi and hand-roll we ate was delicious! The service was great too! There was always a server or waiter walking around and was also knowledgeable about their menu too. The reason for a 4 star review and not a 5 star review is due to us having to sit outside. We weren't able to get reservations for any inside seating. So, we opted to sit outside and it was noisy, cars honking their horns, panhandlers, and an occasional entrepreneur trying to sell their hand made soaps. I'm sure if we had the opportunity to sit inside, this would have a higher chance of being a 5 star review. Oh! Off topic but their restroom is big and clean too! Would I come back? YES! DEFINITELY!

Santō, who is originally from Mexico City, has now opened their first US location in the heart of Silver Lake. The menu is rather limited, but the space excels at fresh sashimi and nigiri with a few interesting roll options as well.Making a reservation was beyond difficult, we couldn't book a spot until October via Resy. I don't believe they listed a phone # so we couldn't call either to inquire. My friend and I decided to go right when they opened at 5pm hoping to grab a spot, which we did as there were only 4 other people dining when we walked in.The space is beautiful, but VERY small. The only dining is sushi bar, window sill, or 2 tables outside -- in total I think the space holds less than 24 people. Below is what was tried:SEARED O'TORO SASHIMI - 5 Stars. Could not have been more fresh or delicious, beautiful presentation as well. They actually sear the Toro in front of you which is a nice touch.SANTO TIRADITO HAMACHI - 5 Stars. A perfect bite! Fresh, tasty, and so delicious!DARUMA ROLL - 4 1/2 Stars. Soft shell crab and avocado, this was quite good!DOUBLE DRAGON ROLL - 5 Stars. This is quite the complex roll and works perfectly! Packed with flavor and the texture of the shrimp tempura adds a nice touch to this roll.SALMON HAND ROLL - 4 Stars. The salmon quality was excellent, and overall this was quite a solid hand roll.CRISPY SOFT SHELL CRAB HAND ROLL - 4 1/2 Stars. This was the best hand roll of the two, and quite good!The food presentation was excellent, the service was friendly and attentive, and the overall vibe was great inside. Beer, wine, and sake only, so if you're looking for a cocktail this is not your spot.

They talk the talk, but when it comes to the fish, they do not walkthe walk. I give it 2 not 1 star because of it is a new business. Sure, it's better than your average place when it comes to selection, but they do not seem to pick the best fish, and do not seem to know how to flavor the fish delicately, Maybe is their style of sushi. which I've found to be the case in many Non Japanese owned sushi bars. They use too much vinegar. Also every pieces of nigiri I ordered rice are weird shape and falling apart. They use too much sauce to cover the fish flavor. Ambience is good. I give 2 star for the ambience.Overall this is a mediocre place.","3822 Sunset Blvd Los Angeles, CA 90026",4.7,18,"Japanese, Coffee & Tea, Sushi Bars",

Our server was very nice until he tried to rip us off. We received our bill for a table of 3 to be split equally. One of us gave cash towards the bill with the rest to be split among 2 cards. We all knew what the total bill was. The server used the table mobile card scanner. The server was extra chatty the entire time he was running our cards. He ran my card and as I selected the 20% tip option, the total was a lot more than I was expecting. I didn't take a copy of my receipt, because I trusted that the bill was correct. As we left, I asked my friend who also paid with card how much she was charged,  to my surprise we were both confused as to why we were charged so much. We debated if we should be those people and question the bill, (please note that he was taking almost $80.00) more than what we saw on the bill so we decided to straight to the server to ask him. He gave us some BS answer and told us our bill total was an amount way larger than what we all saw on the printed bill - which still did not make any sense. We then approached the Hostess to explain our dilemma. She seemed annoyed with  us and gave us major attitude for wanting to speak to the manager. At this point the server comes back very apologetic, saying that their system didn't recognize the cash that was suppose to be added towards the bill. He said he would return both card charges, and would give us 20% off the bill. We both then ran our cards again for the correct amount. We were never refunded the original charge nor did he give us 20% off. Very disappointing.","1717 Vine St Los Angeles, CA 90028",4.4,75,"Bars, Asian Fusion, Thai",

It's inside a hotel and the door to the street is closed from the outside so you have to enter through the garage. Then you take the elevator to the 6th floor. It's a rooftop bar/restaurant. The bar looked really nice. We were there for lunch so we didn't stop by the bar. I got the corn esquite with chicken and my friend got the chermoula. Mine was a nice sized chicken on top of corn.

They cater to guests attending the Pantages, so they try their best to get you in & out in a timely manner before the shows. Due to the staff being so busy, we were a little short on time by the time our server came to take our mains. He promptly offered to comp the entree and put a rush on it, and whatever leftovers we had they could store at the front, temperature controlled. (AMAZING)When we finally received the main, they also brought out another dish we had asked about but didn't order due to the timing. Without even asking or saying a word, they comped us 2 mains and a round of drinks.10/10 for this restaurant. I don't normally write reviews, but this service was the best I've ever received.

Beautiful views. Cool vibe. I hope this place stay's exactly as amazing as it is! Cheers!","1717 Vine St Los Angeles, CA 90028",4.4,75,"Bars, Asian Fusion, Thai",

While I could be particular about some minor things about the restaurant I have no reason to think this place is below 5 stars.We started at the bar where Raphael made us some fantastic classic Negronis! We got the Brussels Sprouts to start-which had the right amount of char with their flavor. Some bites were citrusy and others not so much, which I liked. The Duck Confit was fantastic! The meat was tender as but the skin was the real game changer (normally I pass on the skin). The scallops were the special and were the most tender I've ever had! And I don't even like scallops! We wrapped it up with the Mushroom Pizza which was stuffed with Ricotta. Our server, Seth, was friendly, attentive, and informative of the menu. The only other issue we had was that the real scenic spots were saved for the night life-but that makes sense from a business standpoint. Otherwise, this is a great spot!","1717 Vine St Los Angeles, CA 90028",4.4,75,"Bars, Asian Fusion, Thai",

Was getting tired of going to the dumpling place across the street before a show, so looked to my trusty Yelpers for some help. When I first came upon Lemon Grove, I wasn't sure we'd be able to just walk in. On their site, you can only make a reservation with a credit card. But we took a chance and stopped in. I like that it's not super evident when you're looking for it LOL. Made me feel like we were on a treasure hunt. Well, what a treasure it was! The service is off the charts. I don't know the name of the hostess, but from the moment we stepped in until we paid our bill, I felt like royalty. My vegan husband was super excited to see the mushroom dish (pic attached) and what is usually a very humdrum ""house salad"" in most places was remarkably fresh and tasty here. My daughter had pizza and I experienced the tastiest kale salad. My only regret was not having enough room in my belly for more of the ""bougie chips and dip""!! Lastly, the ambience cannot be beat at this rooftop restaurant.","1717 Vine St Los Angeles, CA 90028",4.4,75,"Bars, Asian Fusion, Thai",

It doesn't look like much from outside but when you step in, it's like stepping into a Mexican jungle. The food was good, the drinks were good, the service was good, and the vibes were good! When we first got there, it wasn't many people. When we left, the place was packed.  The spirit menu has a lot of good quality tequilas to choose from and they also have a good selection of tequilas to purchase. I bought a bottle of tequila that is exclusively for Mirate to add to my tequila collection. I cannot wait to taste it!!","1712 N Vermont Ave Los Angeles, CA 90027",4.2,387,"Bars, Mexican",
99,2023-09-14,2023-09-17,Mirate,"This restaurant is absolutely beautiful, such an oasis. You walk up a stairwell, leading you to the restaurant and there are so many different areas for seating. Great for a girls night out or a date.Drink: I got the Tommy's Margarita. It was okay, a classic marg. Originally, I ordered El Taquero but mentioned I don't like mezcal so asked for regular tequila. When I got the drink, it wreaked of mezcal, it smelled so smokey. When I had a sip, I honestly couldn't drink it... I really don't like mezcal. I told the waitress that I think the bartender made it with mezcal accidentally and she said he didn't, and mentioned the seasoning they put in it is really smokey... I was confused why she wouldn't warn me about how smokey the drink is when I mentioned in the beginning I didn't like mezcal. I asked for a new drink and the waitress seemed pretty annoyed and had a little 'tude with me because when I asked for a minute to decide what to order next, she took over 10 mins to come back to me.Food... very lackluster.Smashed Avocado: Their version of a guacamole, if you could even call it that. It's truly what the name is, it's smashed avocado. No seasoning, no other ingredients mixed in. Not my type of guac at all, I like a chunky guac. Absolute pass. I think I had a single bite, it was like baby food. Also expensive, $13.Coctel de Mariscos: Very overpriced for what you get. You get the same circular sheets of tortilla chip that came with the smashed avo and there's a very small bowl of ceviche. Most of it is avocado, not nearly enough fish inside, and most of it is cheap cuts of octopus. $21Pork Belly Taco: Plated beautifully. However, the flavor was completely disappointing. I honestly questioned if I had covid when eating this (I didn't) because there was that much lack of flavor. Would pass on ordering this. $8Cochinita Pibil: Comes with 3 tortillas. A small portion of pork shoulder and beans in a bowl with spices. Topped with... you guessed it, more avocado. This was solidly okay. $28Clearly, the food was a huge miss for me, but it's possible I ordered all of the wrong dishes. If I were to rate it on the food, I'd probably give it 2 stars and sorry to say, that might be generous. The decor itself is such a draw, it's stunning and that alone would make me come back for a drink, so I'm adding a star for that, but just don't expect much from the food. Very overpriced for what you get.","1712 N Vermont Ave Los Angeles, CA 90027",4.2,387,"Bars, Mexican",

I am an animal lover by the way love dogs however, I don't want to do fine dining with them. Leave your dogs at home or go somewhere else for sure, the dogs are jumping up and down. They set us next to a lady with the dog we asked to be moved so that we could dine in peace. They said they cannot move us to another table as they were full, but there was an empty table away from animals, and they said no shortly after they sit someone else there it's unfair to not let people know that this is a dog restaurant the food not something to write home about. You guys all know I'm a foodie anyone that follows me no way no how will I ever come back to this place, service was not to par for the prices that they are charging.

These servers and bartenders are well and highly trained individuals with impressive knowledge of the Mezcal offerings and of the menu and are extremely attentive and helpful-Food is amazing. Lots of different options of the menu. Only complaint is inconsistency of dish sizes. They recommend sharing but some are tiny some are huge. I love the fried chicken taco and their ceviches.-Drinks/cocktails are phenomenal. Their mezcal offerings might be the best in LA. They have a dedication towards local Mexican Mezcal farmers and have direct relationships with many of them. Talk to Zach the bartender. He will leave you in awe.It can get a bit pricy but worth every penny. Highly recommend for a date night or a special night out.

Decor was very nice and warm. But that doesn't make up for the staff.As soon as we sat down, the French server (how he introduced himself) copped an attitude. From sneering when we initially asked for water to only carding me even though the entire table ordered alcoholic drinks (I was not the youngest nor did I look it, but I was the only Asian person...), he acted as if we were inconveniencing him and wanted us gone.He never returned once we got our food and after sitting around for 20+ min after finishing, someone from our table finally got up and walked to the counter to ask another server for the bill and boxes. Waited for another 5 min and no one came, but saw him chilling at the counter chatting away. I finally made eye contact with him and we made the same request for the bill and boxes. He snapped, ""Okay, I will do it when I have time!"" before stomping away.

It's a cute space that's kinda like a quaint Parisian or Sicialian bistro with its ambiance and style. It's light and airy, even for California. Friend arrives and we decide on our entrees.We both ordered salads. Mine, the Mediterranean Salad with salmon came out looking good. My friend's, the Asian Chopped Salad was covered in edamame despite its removal being requested and the ordered salmon wasn't there. After fixing the salad, a few bites in there was a hair. They addressed this by replacing the salad and comping the first salad but not the salmon. It was an odd way to fix the issue but my friend wasn't mad so neither was I.Another attempt to soothe things was selling us on the idea that their bread was good so we ordered some. It was warm and tasteless. A little olive oil drizzle with some garlic would've gone a long way.

As far as the food, you can tell they make everything in house with fresh ingredients, especially their breads and sauces. The shakshouka was amazing as was the French toast. Brunch was so good I couldn't wait to go back for dinner. I finally made it back and tried the crispy mushrooms and rigatoni. Our server described the mushrooms as vegan calamari and that was spot on, so good and not too mushroomy actually.

101,2023-09-13,2023-09-17,Ha Sun Saeng - Master Ha,"I was in Los Angeles, and, coming from San Diego, knew that it was next to impossible to get a Korean raw marinate crab. There just isn't quite the customer base required to ensure the product stays fresh. Thankfully, there are places that are able to deliver on the promise of fresh, yet still safe enough to eat raw crab.Master Ha's has a very sleek interior, tasty food, and service to match. Honestly, the only negative I would say would be one, you may have to wait here a while. My understanding is they do not take reservations, and while we were seated immediately, we came at 9 o'clock at night on a Tuesday, arguably one of the slowest times for a restaurant. And the place was still packed.We got the crab as a bowl, which means they pre-clean the crabs for you, but for the full experience, you are supposed to do it yourself. I did take some of that to go, and it was similarly delicious. However, the luxury of having them do it is not something I would complain about. They also give you a crab soup on the side which was very tasty, and a few side dishes. I was particularly fond of the perilla leaves.Bathroom is also very clean, and although the price is a little steep, this is one of the only games in town I understand for this type of product that level of freshness.

The interior was modern with black and gold utensils.Although a bit pricey, the seafood is fresh and comes in a good portion. The restaurant does have a strong smell due to the fresh seafood. Each person gets a bowl of rice and miso soup with crab. My favorite was the salmon handroll and marinated crab bowl. The live uni was colorful and fresh, but nothing too crazy.

Research led me to multiple restaurants in Ktown and Master Ha was one of the most talked about. Since we were worried about peak times, we visited in the middle of the afternoon and found the place empty.Medium Marinated Crab: A medium size is 2 whole crabs, cut into pieces. Each person (we had 3) also got a bowl of rice and crab miso soup. Gloves are provided and it's highly recommended to use these because it's just easier to squeeze out the crab meat with your hands. Take a bite with rice or wrap it in the provided seaweed. SO GOOD! Takes me back to Korea but the only problem is the price. The crab miso soup was even better, maybe even better than the marinated crab itself.Regular Live Uni: Comes with 4 halves of a live uni, filled with rice, roe, 3 pieces of (small) uni, and a raw quail egg. If you want premium, I think that just comes with more uni. This is an IG-worthy dish, very aesthetic. But I could've done without it. You can easily finish each half in like two bites and it's pretty expensive because of the uni.Overall, pretty satisfied with the meal but it's just so expensive compared to Korea. This is definitely not something to be enjoyed often, unless you have the money for it.

The dishes come with rice, a few kimchi side dishes, and some soup. We also got steamed egg but its super small so i would pass on that.First off the uni was my favorite but maybe since its not in season / just starting it wasn't that fresh. I think they definitely try to mask it with quail egg and a lot of seasame oil. I really did like this dish but do wish they used better quality uni itself. The crab- honestly was a bit of a let down. I didn't really like the marinate it lacked flavor compared to the soy marinated crabs im used to. The food came out fast but the place is on the smaller side and gets crowded fast so i would definitely come here on odd hours or when they open because it is not worth it to wait.","1147 S Western Ave Los Angeles, CA 90006",4.4,496,"Korean, Live/Raw Food, Seafood",$$

The host was friendly, but the servers seemed to not have been very attentive. We came a bit before dinner time, so the restaurant was not super busy. Many chances that we were trying to get more water, but every server seemed to be off the floor or busy doing something else.Overall the food was good but nothing life changing. We ordered the garlic noodles which we both agreed was a 7/10. The spring rolls seemed very fresh (8/10). The rice and meat plate was delicious, however the meat was a bit hard to chew through (7/10).Would come back again for a nice fusion meal.","523 W 7th St Los Angeles, CA 90017",3.9,1864,Vietnamese,$$
102,2023-09-03,2023-09-17,Little Sister,"Food is good but this review is for the hostess. Little Sister if you want to keep your customers you probably need to do some training on your hostess/waitress. This pertains to the Asian waitress with blonde hair, she does not seems like she wanna be there. I came in with my family with kids, she sat us down in the back of the restaurant with no booster no high chair and just kept ignoring us. I was still talking to her and she kept walking away and does not provide any proper service. Very disappointed for a highly rated restaurant. Definitely NOT KID-FRIENDLY.","523 W 7th St Los Angeles, CA 90017",3.9,1864,Vietnamese,$$

102,2023-08-26,2023-09-17,Little Sister,"My vegetarian friends, there are actually NO options on the menu that are actually vegetarian-- however, they offered one off-the-menu vegetarian item that I did quite enjoy, the tofu vermicelli.We started with spring rolls and sesame baguette with pate-- my friends really enjoyed the spring rolls and the bread was delicious and perfectly crispy and buttery soft on the inside. I loved the tomato spread it came with and also dipped my tofu from the bowl into it! Not too acidic, mildly sweet, smooth blended texture.The vermicelli bowl was great, too. I would have loved more sauces as it was a bit dry, and wish some thicker dipping sauce came along for the tofu. But otherwise quite enjoyable. The tofu was nicely crisped and fried but not too oily. The portion was quite big too, and I took half home for next day's lunch!Service here is great, very knowledgeable about the menu and helpful in assisting with dietary restrictions. It's a bit cramped inside, but we came around 2pm when the place was beginning to clear out. I'd hate to come during a busy hour.","523 W 7th St Los Angeles, CA 90017",3.9,1864,Vietnamese,$$

103,2023-08-27,2023-09-17,Mama Shelter Rooftop Bar,"So mamas shelter is a rooftop restaurant located in the middle of Hollywood which can be a good or bad thing depending who you ask. I've gone several times because it's a great place to meet up with friends and grab a drink to start your night. The scene stealer is the view of the Hollywood sign which on a clear day can be easily seen.  Now I did say this is a great place to start the night because the drinks are a bit pricey and you can run up a $100 tab real quick, so I usually come for a quick pre game then take off to wherever the night takes me. As for the food I've only had the Thai chili wings and salt&pepper shrimp which both are solid bar food but nothing amazing.

While online it looks so clean and cute, it is filthy and the furniture is cheap, dusty, and wobbly. The music is so loud you can't hear the person across the table. The bathroom being so disgusting for a place where the cheapest entree is over $25 is really telling of the vibe you're signing up for.Save you and your friends the trauma of crossing the scariest and dirtiest part of LA to be treated subhuman and go literally anywhere else, maybe somewhere where FREE parking is even remotely an option.

103,2023-08-12,2023-09-17,Mama Shelter Rooftop Bar,"Great food, but uncanny service. From the moment we sat down we never felt welcome in a place that was not extremely busy to begin with. Service was rude, unprofessional, and nothing like I've ever experience in LA before. After asking for a manager to speak with in regards to the level of service instead of the manager attempting to sway our thoughts and resolve the experience we were having, he decided to add insult to injury by coming back with the bill and asking us to pay and leave. Bare in mind our order of food still had not arrived, and his words were ""that's fine, but at this point I'd like you guys to leave.""  We were nothing kind to the servers that came, nothing but kind to the manager, but for whatever reason he felt a need to give us the boot rather than listen to what our problem was with the service which resulted in us asking for him in the first place. I can't say I will ever return to this establishment and I can't imagine they can stay in profitable in a business such mannerism towards any of their guests. I only hope that ownership and the public see this, first to make sure things are put in order there, second for the public to not go to a place where the employees just have no desire to be there no value to their guests","6500 Selma Ave Los Angeles, CA 90028",3.5,804,"American (New), Cocktail Bars, Wine Bars",$$

105,2023-09-02,2023-09-17,Meteora,"First and foremost to Jordan Kahn for a remarkable meal. We visited for the Cos wine paired dinner. I appreciated the molecular gastronomy very much, the well balanced dishes, all presented beautifully. It would have been five stars if not for the snarky staff.The decor was interesting, created a dark, intriguiging mood. The tableware was original and fun.All of our servers were great, but could have been more detailed with the very original, and unique dishes, how they were prepared, what techniques, and the background of the unusual products. However, the host/floor manager who came by a couple of times was rude, snippy, unprofessional, and unpleasant considering we each paid over $200 per plate for the evening. The place was quite empty. We asked to be moved to the patio to have a bit more peace as the music was loud with a driving beat. He said the music would soften, but it did not. He refused to bring it down a notch. We could barely focus on the food. The answer was a curt ""no"", with no reasoning whatsoever.My dining partner asked for a bit more wine with the first tasting. We had driven 90 minutes to the restaurant on a busy night and she wanted to relax. The host or floor manager's reply was a snippy, ""You'll get your 3 glasses in. No. We can't serve you any more of the tasting wine.""  Such rudeness and assumption we were there for 3 glasses of wine? Seriously?The final issue were the restrooms. One was unusable as some male had missed the toilet altogether and the floor was a puddle of personal ""liquid"" and the other toilet was clogged. Co-gender restrooms may be ""in"", but again, when you've planned for a nice evening out, visiting a smelly or messy restroom is just disgusting.We won't be going back. The food was quite good, but the experience of the loud pounding music, the host/floor manager's attitude, brought for a pretty unplesant evening altogether, and for $200+ per person, it's highway robbery.","6703 Melrose Avenue Los Angeles, CA 90038",4.0,320,American (New),$$$$

Usually I like burgers medium but after reading reviews on Yelp, I learned that you must ask for no pink if you want the burger not to come out a bit raw. So, I ordered no pink and got a medium to medium well cooked burger which tasted really good.  Ordering can be done with the waiter or by scanning a QR code with your phone. I preferred ordering and paying by phone which was very convenient. My wife didn't notice the QR code order I placed and she was surprised that the waiter brought her drink as if by magic. Haha.

108,2023-09-05,2023-09-17,Honey Night,"I've been searching for good pocha spots all over Koreatown, and this place definitely knows its audience. Most people in here were speaking Korean (sadly, I wish I could), one of the waiters was dancing at one point, another took shots with a table who seemed to be regulars, and they played music that made you feel hyper, chill, and happy at the same time. We could still talk, but it's definitely very vibrant and busy, so be prepared to talk a little louder. I didn't mind, though.We got two of their signatures, the Cheesy Fire Chicken with Rice Balls (Level 1 Spice), and their Galbi Fried Chicken which came with fried tteok and fries.The cheese buldak was so sauced and decadent. It's best in the very beginning when it's still hot and the cheese was melty. At the end of the day, though, the oil did build up and didn't feel amazing.The fried chicken was sweet and salty, still super crispy after the three hours that we stayed for. That's a very niche skill that I wish other places had!We also shared two bottles of soju, and they were pricey but not unlike soju bottles at other restaurants. Would love to come back again!","3526 W 8th St Los Angeles, CA 90005",4.7,471,"Korean, Bars",$$

The chicken is so savory and paired with the rice is just *chefs kiss*Dduk bok ki was the perfect amount of chewiness but we were expecting something a bit more spicer. It's probably at a mild-medium level of spice.Seafood pancake was delicious and paired well with the other dishes.

It's 100% better at night when the place is popping with K-pop music and gives off a family-owned Korean pub vibe. Service was great and we left loving this place.Recently we went right at opening at 6 PM on a Sunday. There was only one other party beside us, no music, and just one worker. Each table has a button you can press whenever you needed something. Service was okay. The waiter only came when we pressed the button. He wasn't attentive so we didn't get water refilled and had to flag him down to order.Scallop Skewer: Tiny scallop balls that weren't good. Hard pass.Spicy Cheese Chicken & Rice Balls ($32.99): This was really good, and perfect to share with 2-3 people.Pork Belly With Fried Kimchi (23.99): The pork belly was dry and flavorless. They gave a sauce to dip it in but that didn't help. The fried kimchi  was amazing but it still doesn't justify the price.Galbi Sauce Fried Chicken ($19.99): This was bomb! The sauce was so good on the chicken and rice cake which were both fried to perfection. The fries were meh though. Also, the portion size has shrunk from the last time we were here.Fish Cake Soup ($22.99): My friend was raving about this and it did not disappoint! The soup along was super flavorful and had a nice little kick to it. The fish cake was delicious, one of the best I had.

109,2023-09-11,2023-09-17,Izakaya Osen - Los Angeles,"I'm surprised how busy this place is, considering the mediocre quality of food. Felt like some amateur food made at home, and the host was not very welcoming. It was packed inside, so we asked to sit outside, which was pretty empty. Only one table had 2 guests and then my guest and I came. We were seated at a table for two, and because it was empty, we decided to move to a table that would seat 4. The host came to find out and said, ""I thought I made myself clear. I told you to sit over there, for a table of two."" I understand that they may have expected to get busy for the evening, but I was caught off guard with ""I thought I made myself clear"", like we were getting disciplined.I love Japanese skewers and have eaten them at various restaurants in different parts of L.A., San Francisco, San Jose, New York, etc..I wanted to try a new place and that is how we ended up at Izakaya Osen, which is the worst for Japanese skewers. I highly doubt these were grilled. After years of eating these, I found Izakaya Osen to be a place that should probably reconsider how they're cooked. Definitely not being grilled here.We also ordered a couple of hand rolls, and the presentation and quality of food felt like we were at home and took our chances on trying to making some.Never coming here again. Too expensive for what is offered, and the waitress kept waiting for us to pay and struggled to leave us be at our table..

Getting reservations was a breeze, setting the tone for an evening filled with culinary delights.Upon arrival, we opted for seats at the bar, which turned out to be an excellent choice. The cozy and vibrant atmosphere at the bar added to the overall charm of the place. Yum I was out server and she was amazingNow, let's talk about the star of the show - the food. We started our culinary journey with the Kushiyaka, featuring a delightful combination of chicken gizzards and sea bass. The flavors were exquisite, and it was a testament to the chef's skill.Next up, we couldn't resist trying the crab hand roll, which was a true masterpiece. The generous helping of crab paired with perfectly seasoned rice and wrapped in seaweed made each bite an absolute delight.The seaweed salad with pickles was a refreshing interlude, offering a balance of textures and tastes. It was a delightful way to cleanse our palates before moving on to the next course.The Spicy Tuna on Crispy Rice was another standout dish. The contrast between the spicy tuna and the crispy rice base created an explosion of flavors in our mouths. It was a creative and delectable twist on a classic.As if that weren't enough, the sea bass Seabass Croquette was the perfect finale to our culinary adventure. The croquette was crispy on the outside, revealing a melt-in-your-mouth sea bass interior. It was a symphony of flavors and textures that left us craving for more.To complement our meal, we enjoyed a Kirin Ichiban beer, which was the ideal choice to accompany the diverse flavors of our dishes.In summary, our visit to this restaurant was a delightful journey through Japanese cuisine, highlighted by attentive service, a vibrant atmosphere, and dishes that were nothing short of spectacular. Whether you're a seasoned foodie or just looking for a memorable dining experience, I wholeheartedly recommend giving this place a try. It's a culinary adventure you won't want to miss.

I really liked the natto tofu though I'm probably in the minority. It's super slimy, rich from the egg yolk, and umami from the shoyu.

110,2023-09-12,2023-09-17,Kingdom Dim Sum,"Having eaten lots of dim sum over the years, I don't say this lightly. I just ate what is possibly the best dim sum that I have ever had. The caveat is this, my wife doesn't eat pork or beef, and both of us don't eat shrimp anymore. So, that makes it often difficult to find dim sum that we like. That wasn't always the case, and we've eaten plenty of conventional dim sum at a wide variety of restaurants. When I looked at Kingdom Dim Sum online, I was impressed that they have so many items made with chicken. Often, the chicken dumplings taste like they were frozen and just steamed before serving. This is not the case with Kingdom. In fact the thing that makes their dim sum stand out to me is the FRESHNESS of the food. This is not in SGV, but very near Thai Town in a new-ish plaza off Hollywood and Western. There is quite a bit of free parking. Restrooms are clean and newer. The place is airy and bright, simply decorated.Ordering is done through scanning a QR code that leads you to an online ordering app. A little challenging for old folks like us, but doable. Lots of delivery and takeout, but we dined in.  Smaller place with about 8 small tables for 2 or 3. Pretty difficult to have a large group. A lot of the dim sum seems to be made fresh when you order it, so there is some lag time. We first got the sticky rice with chicken wrapped in lotus leaf. That was probably steaming for some time, so was ready quickly. Very tasty and not mushy. The chicken siu mai were very large, tasty, and fresh. The pan-fried chicken dumplings were very good. The wide rice noodle filled with chicken were so fresh and delicate in texture. The turnip cake was hot off the grill with a thin, crisp crust. The pan-fried chicken bao was slightly crusty, soft, and tasty. The custard tarts were amazing. The crust was more delicately crumbly than flaky. It was filled with a thick layer of egg custard that was unbelievably delicate in texture and flavor. One order of each of the above cost us $48, not including tip. Service was good.","5445 Hollywood Blvd Ste B Los Angeles, CA 90027",4.4,76,"Dim Sum, Cantonese, Hong Kong Style Cafe",

The sandwiches are made to order, although we were told there are sometimes some premade in the case for grab-and-go. We ordered the chicken pesto and The Picnic, both came with a side salad. The food was REALLY good. The chicken on the pesto seemed like it was sliced from the breast. Love that! There was a slight hint of mayo on the sandwich that blended extremely well with the pesto. Creative! My spouse loved The Picnic, repeatedly mentioning the ciabatta tastes fresh.  There is plenty of seating, even an indoor balcony with seating!The restaurant was very clean.

The coffee is well balanced, not too sweet, not too bitter, and a good temperature -- I hate when my coffee gets cold after 5 minutes. We ate here, so everything was served in nice plates and glasses. Utensils were the wrapped plastic disposable type, but then I suppose you don't need to worry about how well they were washed.The pastries were fresh, moist, flavorful but not overly sweet.

This is our 1st time here  so we were amazed by the secret entries the 8th floor offered.  When we were at the bar at LaLoLa for our next outing (diff elevator, BTW), we did 1 round of 4 cocktail drinks and found some seatings and enjoyed the great view. After 40ish mins or so we then went to the bar and ordered the 2nd round. I asked the bar goer/s what were they drinking and they recommended the Palomar. I looked at the ingredients of the drink and asked if there were any cotton candy (which is on the menu) and they said no. So I jokingly asked the bartender ((Rob (shift around 10 ish 11pm) on 08/31)) if there were any discounts for the drinks due to the lack of the missing ingredient, cotton candy and he made a remark to me of having an immigrant mentality.  I find this is super offensive. What kind of remark is that just because I am Asian?  QUESTION, would he have said that if I was white or any other race (?). I hope you will address this with your team to build a better customer service within your establishment. We are living in LA and is a well diverse community.  So choose your words wisely, there are many bar goers with different ethnic, race, backgrounds, and gender, pls RESPECT.1 star for attitude4 stars for drinks3 overall","1260 S Figueroa St Los Angeles, CA 90015",3.8,50,"Tapas Bars, Tapas/Small Plates, Cocktail Bars",$$$

The music was so loud it was almost unenjoyable to be there. You had to shout to be heard by the person next to you. Our server took our initial drink order and never came back. Our first round of drinks came quickly, but our appetizers and desserts took over an hour. We ordered the dates and gelato. The dates were cold when we got them and the gelato was half melted.

My Korean wife and I each had combos - she had Cold Noodles/Anchovie-Pepper Kimbob and I had the Udon/Squid kimbob (we shared the kimbob rolls - both were amazing, as was the udon.) I'm not a huge fan of cold noodles but my wife said hers were incredible.Huge portions. It's very rare I leave anything to bring home, but I couldn't finish the squid rolls, and my wife took home half her anchovie/pepper rolls.  Still, we both left feeling very full. But beyond the size of the portions, the quality was genuinely excellent. Fresh, perfectly seasoned and balanced, and the kimbob, as others have pointed out in their reviews, were not overstuffed with rice - each roll was packed full of the good stuff. The combos come with a Dijon (I think)-based dipping sauce that was perfect.The service was cheerful, prompt and helpful. Prices are very reasonable.Parking is a little tight, but there's an additional lot in the rear and we were able to park with no problem. It's free for an hour.The only very minor negatives I would point out are the hours - they close at 2.30 pm, and are closed completely on Sunday. Hopefully demand will require that they expand those hours soon.We're definitely coming back again soon and encourage you to try Ggor Ghap!","3959 Wilshire Blvd Los Angeles, CA 90010",4.7,33,"Korean, Specialty Food, Breakfast & Brunch",

I arrived at opening, and didn't have to wait long. The staff is quick and efficient with getting food out, and it is a cozy restaurant with indoor and outdoor seating.Each taco is fairly substantial, so 2 is a good place to start if you don't want to be stuffed. Tempted to try multiple different tacos, we order 6 for a party of 2 and had leftovers for later.

116,2023-08-30,2023-09-17,HomeState,"Reminds Me of TexasHad lunch plans with a friend and stumbled upon this gem. HomeState serves Tex-Mex style food, and as someone from Texas, I can confidently say that this place delivers on that premise. The menu itself is pretty straightforward -- they have tacos, chips, salads, quesadillas, side dishes, etc. They also serve booze which is a major win in my book. I ordered their frito pie, a brisket taco, and Ranchwater to drink, and none of it disappointed. The frito pie came in a frito's bag and immediately took me back to being high school in Texas.The place itself is small, but neatly organized and definitely has a Texas kind of vibe and ambiance. The place gets full pretty quickly depending on the time of day.Whether you're homesick for some Tex-Mex style food or just want delicious, cheap food you can't go wrong with HomeState.

The service was extremely attentive and helpful as well!

Not enough bread, which is why we got the focaccia.Roasted eggplant: we thought it would be like baba ganoush, but it was more minty, less creamy. Eggplant was a little tough. Unique but I wouldn't get it again.Marinated golden beets*: so so good. Probably my favorite of the night.

My wife loved the beet salad and we had to have them box it up to save room for the rest of the meal.  The pizza came out quickly and was delicious.  This was probably our least favorite of the dishes but still a great option.  The half chicken was the star.  It was deboned, juicy, flavorful with a crispy skin.  It was some of the best chicken I have ever had.  Highly recommend it.  For dessert we had the budino and the chocolate  cake.  The budino was amazing and I would get it again.  The chocolate cake wasn't anything special but was lack luster compared to the budino.  We will be back. I hope it will be consistently this good. Prices are high but it was one of the best meals we had this year.We parked off national in the garage next to the metro.

The branzino is so well marinated with olive oil and confit tomato, among other zesty ingredients.  We also ordered the Margherita pizza, which was also delicious (feel free to dip it on the oil of the branzino).

119,2023-09-15,2023-09-17,Firefly,"Celebrated a special occasion here. From the outside, the restaurant looks very lowkey. When you first enter, you'll see the bar where you can order drinks. Walk a little further and then there is the library lounge. If your table isn't ready yet, you can hang out there.We got seated at the outdoor patio. To start, I had the Pineapple Express cocktail. It was pretty good. I also tried the Western Sour cocktail, which was not bad. It was kind of unfortunate though that they did not bring us any water and we had to end up asking for some.Considering this is a nice restaurant, I was expecting better customer service. But the service was just average. They initially brought our cocktails to the wrong table. Then brought our appetizers to the wrong table. Then again brought the rest of our food to the wrong table.For appetizers, I tried the Meatballs and Bigeye Tuna Tartare. Both were delicious. The meatballs were perfectly cooked and full of flavor, while the tuna was fresh.The Mushroom Pappardelle was defintely my favorite dish of the night. The pasta had a delicious truffle cream and lots of mushrooms. The Steak Frites was much less enjoyable. I requested the filet mignon to be cooked medium rare of course. The meat was not tender and kind of bland even with the sauce. At least the frites were nice and crispy and came with a yummy garlic aioli dipping sauce.Got a side of Garlic Smashed Potatoes, which I really liked. The potatoes were soft and the saffron aioli was unique in a good way.To end the meal, I had a Molten Chocolate Cake. The taste of the chocolate was very strong. Eating the cake together with the horchata ice cream was a perfect combination.Valet is your best option for parking.

119,2023-09-09,2023-09-17,Firefly,"I'm pretty critical with places when the price is high and can set a high bar. In this case it's a 4.75. Disclosure: I read reviews where people complained about waiting a long time after being seated for food or service. Let me say that you can wait awhile BUT stop and take in the atmosphere, vibe and company you came with and that won't matter. For what you'll spend, relax and enjoy your time.Waiter was very nice, attentive and genuine. We got the Mac and Cheese, Meetball appetizer, Shrimp fettuccine and Pappadella Mushroom pasta. All the food was great. Only recommendation is the Shrimp Pasta only had 3 shrimp. The meatball appetizer SHOULD definitely be a pasta dish on the menu! That sauce is amazing! The sauces and pastas were great. The sauces were the kind you want to dip your bread in and take in every bite. (Foodies know what I'm talking about) Being Portuguese, we're VERY critical about pasta and sauce and what is ""wipe the plate clean status"".The bread comes with a butter and sauce on top of the butter. Texture, taste and presentation made this place I'd have special occasions at for sure.The ONLY two things that were disappointing is parking and the bathroom. Parking does not exist and is on a very busy street. Your only options are Valet at currently $10 or park a distance and walk there.The bathroom is a unisex bathroom with three sinks located to the left, 3 stalls and one bathroom at the end with a men's urinal. Twice I had to use the restroom and the seat of the toilet was up. No big deal but something I'd like to avoid having to deal with.Overall great place. Hope to see the meatball appetizer be a main dish with pasta AND will definitely come back day one it hits the menu.Note: Didn't post pictures of the food because the pics already on here match what I'm saying.

120,2023-08-30,2023-09-17,Mr. T,"Nestled in an unassuming corner, @mrtlarestaurant was charming and had an inviting ambiance 6.5/10. While its location might not be the most prominent, the atmosphere within was certainly a highlight. The professional staff and attentive service added to the experience.However, the culinary journey took an unfortunate turn. Though each dish was nice on the eyes, the taste itself left much to be desired. The flavors seemed to fall short of the visual promise, leaving us with a sense of disappointment. While the restaurant excels in ambiance and service, the underwhelming taste of the food meant that we would not be coming back.Ambiance 1.5/2Creativity 1.5/2Presentation 1.5/2Service 1.5/2Taste .5/2","953 N Sycamore Ave Los Angeles, CA 90038",4.5,97,French,$$$

120,2023-08-21,2023-09-17,Mr. T,"I came back from a work trip and thought driving up from San Diego to LA on a Friday night was worth a bit of a splurge for dinner. Mr. T was near my place and I had it down as a 'one day soon,' place, somewhere that needed a bit of an occasion to go to and not just a regular place. The minimalist interior, the neon sign it definitely didn't have that 'Tuesday night dinner' kind of vibe.I gambled that it wouldn't be packed on a Friday night and while it was busy it was very easy to get a table on their patio which was open enough to be mellow but seemed to magically block out the cement plant across the street.I wasn't driving so when the server came by I ordered their twist on an Old Fashioned, the Double Up. I've decried a 20 dollar cocktail before and I will again here-but it was tasty, that can't be denied. I think fat-washed spirits are a bit much, or I did until here, it wasn't just the flavor but the heft of it. The coconut oil was a better call then say bacon fat, which I think leaves too much residue. Look, it's 20 bucks, I still think it's a bit overpriced but I'd get it again while grumbling that it might be 2 bucks more than it should.What I'm definitely more comfortable splurging on are appetizers/small plates/shareables so the lamb kebab, chip n' dip and the croquettes were all ordered and devoured. The kebab was delicious with the lamb being right at the edge of tender/game-y. The chip and dip was like an upscale version of a basic starter but not overly so, a little tartness, a little savory. Perfect. The croquettes though, all veg, but still so rich.I figured if they could do chips and dip up why not have their burger. I have a clip of the flambe which was a nice touch but without the theatrics it was still a very well-done burger with a bonus of char and that spicy aioli that came with the fries.Our server was so great that it didn't take much convincing to get their desserts which also seemed really simply but done well. All in all it's a great place to go to, make up an occasion, just go.","953 N Sycamore Ave Los Angeles, CA 90038",4.5,97,French,$$$

When we arrived we were greeted and seated right away. Love the open kitchen, bar with the loft ceilings. Alan our server introduced himself. He was excellent, friendly, informative and attentive.My friend and I ordered the craft cocktails, Temperatures Rising and the Mr. T...so good! Food is ordered family style.

Only reason why I didn't give it a 5 was they heavily used this herb , maybe was a sweet basil, I'm not sure.

Wings were good. We'd skip the Sakura/sashimi dish next time.Service was friendly and comfortable. The ambiance is chill and welcoming. Do check out the sake menu cover, so fun!Little fun fact:  On our recent trip to Japan, our local friend explained to us that in Japanese culture, when someone pours sake for you (probably other drinks too?), you're supposed to say ototototototo... so the person pouring knows when to stop. I wonder if that's the namesake for this place?  We had much fun saying it to each other then, and also tonight!","1360 Allison Ave Los Angeles, CA 90026",4.1,129,"Bars, Japanese",$$

She walked us through the different types of sake, made recommendations based on preferred taste profiles, and was very knowledgeable on each type of sake we were curious about. My favorite that was recommended by her was the Junmai Ginjo.Although there was a bit of a wait (~30 minutes for a group of 4 on a Friday night), it was worth every minute. The setting is very welcoming, whether you're on a date, or hanging out with a small group of friends. Good vibes all around.

As a person who loves Japanese food and the culture around it as well, this place just rings true and the food was just something that is extremely memorable.I met Courtney, one of the owners, and she was introduced by my friend who seems to frequent their bar. And that Ototo is the lilttle brother location of their main location, literally beside it, Tsubaki. Their story seems extremely interesting and it really speaks through their food.The vibe and the aesthetic of the bar is very trendy while at the same time it reminds me of when I was in Japan with their bar setting. I love how it is categorized as a sake bar and the amounts of sake they offered was just emaculate! I couldn't say no to sake!!If I remember the menu that night, which I kinda don't but I took pictures of them so I think I'll try to describe them. Their food is just delicious and off the hook though. I wish we had something like that in Vancouver. I know, this coming from the city of sushi abundence..... This is so rare.Soft Shell Shrimp: 7/10Fish paste skewers?: 8/10Tomato Flavour bombs?: 100/10 (Yes 100 out of 10, these are fucking amazing. The way they created a tomato umami condensed jelly to put right on top of the baby tomatoes, holy cow)Croquette: 8/10Chicken Katsu Sando: 10/10Was kinda sad I couldn't have their MOS burger because me and my friend decided to go for late dinner, but still, everything on the menu is just DELICIOUS!! Learning from Courtney, their menu is changed literally almost weekly to fit their sake bar drinks.

They seem to expect tip above that...Always feels wrong and greedy to put the burden on patrons to pay for wages when we are already spending so much money on the food/ supporting the business.As for food, I tried the menchi katsu, amberjack sashimi, prawns, eggplant tempura, and half dozen oysters. My favorites were the katsu, prawns, and tempura. Servings were very small (small plates) but all of these were tasty and had great textures and balance of flavors. I would probably skip the oyster because it was nothing special for the price and they serve it with a basic boring ponzu dressing.We had to wait about an hour to be seated and I think that is usually expected. A lot of people come here for the alcohol offerings and there were tables that were there for the entire 3 hours that I waited and ate. They don't make much of an effort to turn tables if you are ordering alcohol consistently but we did feel pressured to leave as soon as we stopped ordering drinks. They also started rushing our food orders out about this time too.Parking is quite difficult in this area, heads up.","1360 Allison Ave Los Angeles, CA 90026",4.1,129,"Bars, Japanese",$$

The portions are pretty generous and the grilled steak is absolutely amazing. Their Lao crack sauce (the orange one) is a little spicy but so tasty.

And there were only 4 chairs with no more space to place more chairs)The smaller table that she wanted us to sit was at the corner of the restaurant which was closer for her to serve (seemed like she didn't really want to move that much and if we had the bigger table, she needed to walk more i guess/ other customers were sitting at the same row) so we appealed again if it would be okay to sit at the longer table which about 8 people can fit and she had those rolling eyes and said ""yeah- you can sit over there if you want to"" with sarcastic voice and face.Seriously? It only seemed like she was too lazy to serve. If those bigger tables were reserved or there was a wait behind us, we would have understood, but in this situation, her laziness is the only explanation.Everyone in my group got so offended so we decided to leave.

Service here is superior from the moment valet greets you to the moment you walk out.The food is great, fresh, and feels very homey. I had the pancakes, Turkey bacon, fruit, and home fries. To drink I had a peach mimosa. Though I couldn't taste much of the peach given the subtlety of that flavor, it was delicious.Home is a great place for breakfast or brunch as a solo diner, for a date, or for a girls day.

125,2023-09-14,2023-09-17,Home Restaurant - Los Feliz,"TLDR: 2 stars for service; 4 stars for foodThis 3 star review is targeted at their bar set up. Dropped by for brunch on Labor Day weekend around 11am for a party of two. Parking is strictly street parking in the area so give yourself time to circle around the neighborhood. As I put my name down on the list and was quoted ~30 min wait I was also advised that the bar area was open with no wait. My friend and I walked into the bar and saw some high top tables open. We sat on one after confirming with a waiter walking by that those too were considered the ""bar area"". We could see the bartenders making drinks and assumed we would be given menus shortly.About 10 mins passed and nobody had approached us. Behind us was another couple and we leaned over and asked if they had ordered at the bar since they had menus and we weren't sure if that was the expectation. They told us they had been waiting for 20 mins and nobody had come up to them either. They were given menus when they first sat down and told someone would come up to them. They had even walked up to the bar and asked if they needed to put their order there and they were told that again someone would come up to them.That nice couple offered their menus and all four of us continued to wait. At this point it's been 20 mins for us and probably 30 mins for them and despite waiters walking back and forth nobody stopped to check in on us. At this point the other couple goes up to the bar and they let them put in an order there (which if you ask me they should have let them do that when they first asked). At this point I get a text my table will be ready in 5 mins and to confirm I'm still there. The couple tells us that we should just go up to the bar and I tell them we waited long enough that our table was now ready - so much for no wait time at the bar! We left the couple inside the bar area with no food or even water offered to them!!My friend and I were taken to a table in their patio which is really cute and shaded. We ordered the French toast and the green chilaquiles with avocado and medium easy eggs to split. I also got an iced latte.The food was awesome which only makes the whole experience so disappointing. Your service can really tank what was a really tasty meal. The French toast was super fluffy and not too sweet. The berries on the French toast were very fresh and the syrup was warm.The chilaquiles were incredible. I would definitely get these again - they had a nice kick and there was a perfect amount of sauce so the chips weren't soggy. My latte was also very good - it wasn't bitter.Our server was very pleasant and the service once we were at the table was very fast and efficient. Out the door about $50 for both of us which is a great price for food in this part of town.Overall, I wouldn't recommend the bar area if it truly is always this dysfunctional. I was genuinely shocked at how horrible that whole bar experience was and I felt terrible for the other couple who didn't put their name down for a table and were just waiting for service that never came. Just wait for the table if it's always this bad because the food is honestly worth it!","1760 Hillhurst Ave Los Angeles, CA 90027",4.1,3762,"Breakfast & Brunch, Coffee & Tea, American (New)",$$
125,2023-09-12,2023-09-17,Home Restaurant - Los Feliz,"Saturday 8/9-Wife and I stopped here prior to a show at the Greek theatre.  Food and ambiance were fine but I/ we got really poor service.  The server took our order, got us drinks, noticed that it was taking a bit and went to check on it and assured it'd be at our table shortly.  Once the food was delivered he never came back.  I normally order a beer while I wait and one with my meal.  Well- I had to eat my meal with water as he served people around us but I could not flag him down.  ""Sir! Excuse me!"" waving ...he didn't even look our way.  While getting my water refilled, I ask the bus-person (busboy sounds kinda rude to me) if I could order a beer from him b/c the server wouldn't come.  He said he'd tell him.  Well the server brought me a beer when I was finished eating.  I told him, ""I don't need it now, I wanted it with while I was eating-could I just have the check"".  Now my wife thinks I'm being rude b/c I didn't conceal my frustration well enough and she, much kinder than me, is getting mad at me.  Thanks! just what I needed before going to a comedy show.  Anyway, to his credit-the bartender brought the beer back to our table and offered it w/o charge- again, I told him I wanted it with my meal and we had to make it to a show.  It was a little  mistake or oversight on the server's part, but it had a real negative affect on my experience.","1760 Hillhurst Ave Los Angeles, CA 90027",4.1,3762,"Breakfast & Brunch, Coffee & Tea, American (New)",$$

Our 1st waitress kept rushing us to order, and didn't accommodate our needs after we placed our order. She then gave our table to another waitress.

I think it's more of a vibe and take pics of the patron tower vs actually enjoying GOOD quality food. (Social media is taking over, the bar for food quality has gone down significantly, it's now more about vibes and videos)Also they charge a 18% service charge for everyone (per there menu it's applied usually for a party of 5 or more, or for the patron tower (neither applied to us)). Our waitress did not say anything until she gave us the bill. At that time (end of august) it wasn't written anywhere. When we asked her why not? She said ""they just started"". 2 stars for that alone! Communication is key, especially when it comes down to ""new unwritten rules"" that make a difference on what you pay. This is something that should have been updated in writing prior to the start.Service fees are taking over. Doesn't even make sense that's there's a service fee for the patron tower. And of course employers can do as they please w service fees so you're still expected to tip bc in some places the owners pocket the service fee. It's not split amongst the employees.

That's how good it was.Note: their combos only include 1 crab of each, regardless of the size you choose. The only difference between the combo is the soup size. Which is disappointing because how are 5 people supposed to share 1 crab.I'd want to try master Ha's next to see how it compares.","4253 W 3rd St Los Angeles, CA 90020",4.4,173,"Korean, Seafood, Soup",$$$
128,2023-08-16,2023-09-17,Rich Crab,"I'm not a crab connoisseur so maybe take my review with a grain of salt. First off, I love seafood and I love to eat crab but to caveat, I've never had a general liking for the crab/shrimp heads - and eating raw crab was fairly similar to that delicacy.This was my first time eating raw crab. I wasn't sure what to expect so I came in with zero expectations, but I also walked out unsure of how I felt about the meal.I came here with a party of 4. Since it was our first time, we tried the combo so that we can try both of the different flavors. We ordered a size S combo A for $119. Note that the different sizes of combo refers to the stew size. Everything else comes as 1 count.The service was great. Food came out SO fast, it literally felt like we just waited for 5 mins. As soon as it came out, we dug in. I want to say I did enjoy the soy sauce marinated crab but at the same time also wasn't sure if I liked the flavors. The spicy marinated crab was marinated VERY well and spicy too! Loved that there was definitely a hot kick to it. You forsure need to work to eat this though and unfortunately, I'm not a huge fan of peeling crab/shrimp and really digging deep to find gold. Despite all that, it tasted super fresh!The banchan was exceptionally good, and also refillable. Kimchi was great but honestly felt like I got jipped. It's so thin and hardly had any kimchi pieces - it was like eating kimchi paper, not pancake. It was also smaller than what I expected. I've had better kimchi pancakes.We ordered the spicy crab stew for our stew option. Spicy? No. Crabby? Yes. It had a very good depth of flavor in terms of crab. I wish there was more garneses/veggies but the crab pretty much filled up the pot. I didn't get to eat the crab from the pot but I was told by my boyfriend's parents that it wasn't fresh.To be completely honest, I left feeling so unsatisfied. It wasn't that I wasn't full but I think I needed something that tasted more satisfying. I think this delicacy is something everyone should try but I wouldn't consider this a meal I'd crave and want to eat for dinner. To try and experience different types of cultural food? Definitely. But not something I can expect to eat every month. Also, I felt it was super pricey for what it was even though I know these crabs are imported. I'd prefer to eat omakase sashimi for the price.Update: After reading some reviews, I found out from other yelpers that ordering the combo, the crabs would be significantly smaller than ordering a la carte. The waitress failed to mention that to us...which now makes me realize that portioning sizes like this is incredibly unfair to the customer AND super misleading. Not to mention that most people who order combos expect to have a fair ratio amongst the number of people that the menu stated to feed. If your size M combo is supposed to feed 3, give more ratio of crabs rather than your stew, especially if you know people come to your restaurant to specifically try your raw crab.Warning: Any size combo, whether S, M, or L, all combos only comes with 1 small crab per flavor. That's bogus and definitely not worth the price. Had I known, I would've just ordered a la carte. DON'T ORDER THE COMBO.","4253 W 3rd St Los Angeles, CA 90020",4.4,173,"Korean, Seafood, Soup",$$$

In addition to the exceptional crab, the potato pancake was another pleasant surprise, with its satisfying taste and texture.Overall, I found the dining experience to be quite enjoyable, with no complaints to speak of.

130,2023-09-16,2023-09-17,Otium,"I was quite disappointed in the brunch service. First during brunch it is counter service, which you order at a cashier before getting a number and finding a seat.  Well after getting part of my order I was informed they did not have the Stout Pancakes, which I had ordered. Granted it was not on the menu but after I heard the couple in front of me  successfully order them I ordered them as well. Not sure why they didn't address this with me when they brought our the first part of my order, the bacon and bread with butter.When they were looking into the posssible price adjustment for the French toast vs the pancakes they tried to tell me the French toast was more expensive (per their computer) at $24 than the pancakes at $17 and saying they wouldn't charge me the up charge. Well the French Toast on the menu is actually listed as $14. I'm glad I had pics of the menu and a copy of my original e-receipt and after showing it to them they credited me the difference. Weird thing is when they gave me the corrected receipt the French toast rang up as $14. Is it dishonesty or just an honest mistake?The food was good but not amazing.  At the price point for brunch ($50 after tax & tip), it should have been table service with better service over all. Little things like a refill of water you have to get yourself from a community pitcher.  Also to note there is an additional 5% service charge on the bill aside from the gratuity.If this is the service for brunch I can't fathom what it would be like for dinner. I don't plan to return & I regret not going to Jose Andres' restaurant across the street from The Broad for brunch instead.","222 S Hope St Los Angeles, CA 90012",3.9,2414,American (New),$$$
130,2023-09-15,2023-09-17,Otium,I don't even like to write reviews. But I felt the need to let people know why I visit Otium every 6-8 weeks.First of all the environment is lively; you're encouraged to cut through the kitchen to use the restroom to feel the energy and love all your food is being made with.As every trip it's mandatory to start with the Naan and my two favorite dips (since they retired the Chicken Au Jus) are the truffle butter and the bone marrow emulsion.We had the market cucumber salad that looked like a piece of artwork. Followed by (in season) Street Corn Agnolotti that makes you feel like you were on stage of the final table.Some new dishes this time around for me were the Marinated Trị Tip which was divine. And the star for me tonight was the Roasted Chicken over potatoes. Easily one of the best dishes I've had.,"222 S Hope St Los Angeles, CA 90012",3.9,2414,American (New),$$$

130,2023-09-14,2023-09-17,Otium,"Just had dinner at the Otium for the first time and it was an amazing experience. The restaurant features a very rustic and cozy industrial look and I personally loved the lighting of the place. The fireplace in the waiting area before you get seated was a nice touch as well.The food was great as well but there were definitely certain items on the menu that were better than others. For example, I personally wouldn't recommend the duck neck appetizer which we ordered. There was barely any meat on it and it was subpar overall. I would however highly recommend the beef tartare, and lightly recommend the soft shell shrimp as it was good but didn't live up to my expectations. I would say overall the appetizer menu could be a bit better.As for the main items, the gnocchi was phenomenal and some of the best we've had and the duck breast was very hearty and delicious. We have no complaints there.The drinks we had were good, I would recommend the Otium and more so the teatime gimlet if you want more of a refreshing drink.The service was where the Otium really shined. Between the pacing of the appetizers and entrees coming out, the attentiveness of our wonderful waiter who constantly switched out our dirty plates and provided warm towel wipes, and the overall care from staff I was deeply impressed.

The ambience is really nice and modern. The kitchen is wide open so you can see everything being prepared. The fridges have glass doors so you can see the meats hanging in there. The fresh focaccia and desserts are in a display counter by the register. The bar area has fresh ingredients all lined up. Normally you would grab a menu and order at the register before sitting, however they let us sit and took our order at the table.   I opted for the burger. Note that it comes diced pickled peppers which give it a really nice subtle kick...not spicy at all for those sensitive to spicy foods.  This was a really solid burger. I  would order it again. The fries however were not that impressive...kinda basic. I expected more from a $26 burger. Other than that, I got to try one of their 3 freshly baked foccacia breads. The potato focaccia was equally as amazing as the burger. Note that there are no reservations for lunch.","222 S Hope St Los Angeles, CA 90012",3.9,2414,American (New),$$$

It's located in a nicer area of DTLA, right next to the Broad and Walt Disney Concert Hall. Parking is a breeze and I feel safe walking around after dinner, unlike many LA restaurants these days.The Naan bread is to die for and a must order. Our favorite pairing is easily the caviar, but when we're not splurging, the chicken liver mousse is our go to.Every entree we've ordered has been delicious and plenty for 2 to share, but I'm a steak guy so the ribeye takes the crown here.Their pastas are also great, but I've found them to be very heavy, and could probably stand as an entree on their own if you're a lighter eater.Some of their dishes are rather small for the price, like the duck croquet (pictured). The quality and flavors are there, but small portions make some of their pricing not add up.Overall, Otium is a great choice in DTLA for a date night splurge!","222 S Hope St Los Angeles, CA 90012",3.9,2414,American (New),$$$

For example, we started with steamed shrimp dumplings that were $11. We received 7 tiny shrimp dumplings... like one bite and it's gone. Yes, it tasted good but not $11 worthy. Maybe $7? Even the edamame appetizer was $10.Our main dishes were also tasty but the prices were off again. $16 for a plate of stir-fry veggies and shrimp without rice. The Kra Pow was around $13 for a smaller portion with rice.Did the prices break the bank? Absolutely not. However, I feel as though the food and prices did not match up. I'm more than happy to pay a little more for a dish that is out of this world... even if the portion were small.The service was awesome. The kindest staff with constant smiles on their faces.

Street parking can be a bit of a challenge so walking here is always a nice option b.I dropped by a couple weeks back, but we got a bev and dessert to go. Our plan was always to come back for a proper meal.We dropped in after a Sunday hike so we were sweaty and hungry. Unfortunately for us some of the items on the brunch menu were no longer available. Our intention was to get 3 items, but we got two instead with the game plan that we would get something else if we were still hungry. I wasn't sure how big the portion was going to be. It totally worked out that we only got two items. The three tacos were pretty hefty and the salad was packed. We got our desserts to go.The vibe here is super chill. I love the outdoor area. It's definitely a plus when you have a pet with you.Not pictured is the order of cold brew iced coffee I had that was so damn good I almost got another one to go.","143 S La Brea Ave Los Angeles, CA 90036",4.0,972,"Cafes, Bakeries",$$

The staff brought more hot water for my tea and refilled our water glasses. They also clean and turn the tables quickly.Parking.

Lettuce leaves, hot peppers and ssamjang in the refrigerator. On the hot bar, they have Spicy pork with baby octopus, a spicy yam dish, fried mackerel, Korean pancake, sundubu tofu, a fluffy egg dish along with a couple other dishes I think I've missed. The cold bar had spicy crab, bean sprouts, japchae, daikon/carrots and a very nice variety of banchan. There was more that I can't remember but it was all delicious!If you're looking for super authentic homemade Korean food, this is a fantastic new option.

135,2023-09-04,2023-09-17,Rice Chicken,"Was craving some fried chicken takeout and this newly opened store was conveniently near our place. We were attracted to the rice flour the store boasted to use, and wanted to compare it to other popular fried chicken chains.We ordered the 20 pcs Ruby Jade (soy garlic) along with the Deokbokki. The chicken was packaged nicely for takeout, with holes for ventilation and radish provided.Upon first bite, first notice was the crunch of the chicken skin, and the unique flavor the rice flour added to the wings. Combined with the tenderness and juiciness of the flesh, we could tell immediately that the wings were cooked with detail and care. The soy garlic flavor was not overwhelming, and at times felt like could use a little more of the garlic flavor for the hardcore garlic lovers.The Deokbokki was a nice and welcome addition to the meal. Not much to say here, except it was a solid dish that provided a little spice to the meal. We did not add the ramen noodles, but would definitely consider it in a future visit.Overall, the chicken was the best I've had in a while, and felt a lot less heavy and greasy than other chicken places do. I wish they allowed 50/50 on flavors, especially with higher wing counts, as I would have definitely wanted to try the Crowing Rooster (Yang Nyum) flavor. For a newer, less reviewed chicken spot on the block, this place is an undiscovered star.","3065 W 8th St Los Angeles, CA 90005",4.8,57,Chicken Shop,

It currently has an amazing Pokémon X Kogei exhibition featuring art like sculptures and ceramic pieces inspired by Pokémon. It is quite incredible as I've seen exhibits like this in Japan, so it's super cool to see in the states.I made reservations in advance, but they also accept walk ins.

The display featured numerous items, and what really stood out was the fact that many of them were out of their display cases. This allowed visitors to get an up-close look at each item. Note your are not allow to touch the pieces!The attention to detail on these pieces was truly extraordinary. Personally, my favorite part of the exhibit was the evolution of Eevee. Being able to see all three forms of Eevee in one place was a treat for any Pokémon fan! Additionally, the kimonos on display were exquisitely designed, showcasing the rich culture and artistry of Japan.The presence of guards throughout the exhibit ensured that no one touched the items, which is especially important if you have curious kids with you. They also provided reminders about this, which I totally understand.To visit, you'll need to secure a time ticket in advance, which you can easily book on their website. The validation they offer for parking is a nice touch! It comes to $3 for 2 hours. The exhibit took less than a hour.Overall, my experience at Japan House's Pokémon exhibit was a good one. While it may not be the largest exhibit, the quality of the items and the chance to see them up close more than made up for it. If you're a Pokémon enthusiast or simply appreciate fine craftsmanship, this exhibit is worth a visit!","6801 Hollywood Blvd Los Angeles, CA 90028",4.4,64,"Cultural Center, Art Museums, Pop-Up Restaurants",

Finally made the trek over after eating at Smorgasburg for the Pokemon x KOGEI exhibit and it was 1000% worth it. I hope everyone gets a chance to visit before the exhibit ends in January 2024! It's really rare we get such amazing work imported over from Japan, especially a Pokemon collaboration like this one.The Pokemon exhibit is located on the second floor, you can get validated parking for the Ovation Hollywood parking structure. Don't forget to bring your ticket!I recommend you reserve a time slot for your visit to this exhibit. They have walk-ins available, but it depends on the traffic inside the exhibit at the time. I'd say it wasn't overly crowded, but there was definitely a decent amount of people within the entire time. My friend and I spent roughly an hour in the space, as it only spans two large rooms.That being said, the work that they brought over was absolutely stunning. There's a good mixture of Japanese ceramics/pottery, metal work, fabrics/clothing, and more. I'm aware they're rotating a few pieces from the exhibit and will be stopping by to see what they swap in. There are also a few employees there to watch and make sure not one gets too close to the artwork. They're stern, but not rude about it. Just don't lean over the table line or roping and you'll be fine.It's a small exhibit, but worth the trip. I can't wait to come back! I didn't get to check out the 5th floor (which contains a library and event venue), but I'll be making sure to stop by there next time just to see what it's like.","6801 Hollywood Blvd Los Angeles, CA 90028",4.4,64,"Cultural Center, Art Museums, Pop-Up Restaurants",

Love Q and his Q tips!I made a reservation for the Pokemon x Kogei exhibit (July 25, 2023-Jan 7,2024) prior to my visit to Japan House Los Angeles. The reservation and visit was FREE. I thought it was required, but on the day of our visit I saw a long line waiting to enter, so I'm glad we had the reservations.PARKING - Underground parking at the Ovation Hollywood structure. Japan House LA will provide validation so it is $3 for the first 2 hours. It is $2 for every 20 minutes after. From the structure take the elevators or escalators up to Level 2 for the Gallery or Level 5 for the Library.My boyfriend and I started off in the Gallery since we arrived near our appointment time. I presented my reservation email and we were immediately welcomed into the gallery. I'm really grateful that it was a free experience, but I was surprised to see how small the exhibit is. Nevertheless the art they had on display was incredible.The Pokemon x Kogei exhibit is a playful encounters of pokemon and Japanese craft and the amount of details and intricacies that went into every piece displayed is incredible. Staff was also friendly and passion and excited to tell us fun facts about some of the art work as we explored. I could easily recognize the original pokemons but I'm not up to date with all the new ones. It was a fun visit.Then we were off to their Library on the 5th floor of Ovation Hollywood. It was a bit hard to find. At the library staff offered a sampling of matcha tea that was nice and refreshing for a hot summer day. The library was small but still interesting to visit.Nice fun FREE adventure if you are in the area, but it's such a small exhibit I don't know if I recommend it to someone who is coming from far... unless you super love pokemon.

I did compile a fun photo reel via TikTok and Instagram after to capture my experience with Pikachu, Rookidee, Charizard, Shaymin, Gengar and quite a bit of the now over 1k rest!It's best to arrive early if possible though they have a 20 minute grace period before you'd have to try for a different time slot anywhere from 11 AM - 7 PM  in increments of 30 minutes though you're welcome to stay for 45. I was truly impressed with the kindness of all the staff, including security and  personability as well as professionalism.I got turned around and ended up 10 minutes later than planned but was truly grateful for that 20 minute loop hole (thank you frequently asked questions).... Weekends are definitely the busiest days to go, but also the most fun.Previous groups/parties and those proceeding will come and go during your time, but they do limit capacity. They do have some metal ropes in front of some display you should not cross as well as signs for things or areas not to be crossed or touched including the art which is a given for an art collection.You can also enjoy more of Japan House on the 5th level which features a wonderful library, event venue of the multi-purpose variety, high views of the city and pop up restaurant that's done some crazy amazing pop up experiences like Saido's Vegan Way w/ Chef Katsumi Kusu, Defining Modern Kaiseki with Chef Hiroo Nagahara and numerous others.I absolutely want to explore more and come back with friends or family soon... But I have to admit a date day with yourself, taking the train/Metro B Red Line and getting off at the Hollywood/Highland station, less than a 3 minute stroll away is just as fun.When making a reservation for the exhibit online you can add up to 5 guest and must have/input their names though you can make changes up until the time of your schedule visit. Give them your name in front at the reception desk and enjoy your visit.

First of all amazing amazing amazing customer service, they walk you through everything so well. I went with the chicken & waffles - since it was only served on the weekend I figured why not, and I paired that with a side of fries & Mac & cheese. And a side of their special sauce & honey mustard. All of this for $30 bucks. I opted for the chicken tenders with my waffles - and the chicken itself was amazing I got medium+, thank you to the cashier for putting me on the secret heat level because I was contemplating between medium & hot and it was amazing. The waffles tasted like cheap hotel self serve making waffles I did not enjoy. The fries were kinda all crunch, there was no potato on the inside. And the Mac and cheese needed a lot more seasoning. No inside seating l, outside vibes for the ambiance. Overall I would give this place a solid 3.5/5 because the chicken is go good. I will also be back to try the sando.","727 N Broadway Ste 128 Los Angeles, CA 90012",4.7,7642,"Southern, Chicken Shop, American (Traditional)",$$

138,2023-09-10,2023-09-17,Howlin' Ray's,"Figured we'd stop by one of the most well-known hot chicken places in LA while there for a concert. Got there around lunch hour and the line was out the door! Took around 20-30 minutes to get to the front, where they had a couple people taking orders at both the counter and on an iPad to maximize efficiency. Staff were super smiley and offered us some really cute pins and postcards while we had our orders taken.There is no interior seating, but the restaurant is situated in a little food hall of sorts with lots of little shops to check out if you can get a friend to wait in line. There's some seating outside the restaurant, but it can get full pretty quickly.I ordered the chicken and waffles medium hot for $16. Took around 15 minutes which was surprising considering the line. Tenders (3) were sizable and came with waffles, butter, and syrup. I think they use a drier spice rub, so I recommend getting the dipping sauce on the side for an extra charge. The chicken itself was cooked well, still juicy and steaming hot. The waffles were surprisingly good, with the perfect crunchy-soft texture difference. I tried my friends' sandos and fries and would definitely recommend those more though. Solid spot, lives up to the hype.","727 N Broadway Ste 128 Los Angeles, CA 90012",4.7,7642,"Southern, Chicken Shop, American (Traditional)",$$

It's a small spot with outdoor dining only. You stand in line the waiter calls you on at a time to the booth to place your order then you wait out front.It's located in the heart of Chinatown so as you can imagine parking is nonexistent or metered. So be mindful of that.I ordered the Sando in medium and I have a high tolerance to spicy but mannnnn it was spicy! My friend got the tenders and she was equally dying with the medium spice level lol it was like burning but i also couldn't stop eating it. What I found annoying and the reason for 4/5 stars is everything is sold separately. For example if you order tenders it comes with no sauce you have to pay for all the dips you want.Overall, it was great to finally try one of the OGs of fried chicken and I hope to come back and get the Sando in mild lol","727 N Broadway Ste 128 Los Angeles, CA 90012",4.7,7642,"Southern, Chicken Shop, American (Traditional)",$$

I've heard that people waited for 2 hours to get the sandwich so I only stopped by because it was convenient.I went at 3pm so there was much less of a crowd than usual. It took about 20 minutes from the start of the line to actually orderingIt was surprising to find Howlin' Ray's in the middle of Chinatown in LA but at least it was near some familiar shops. I was tempted to get the spiciest sandwich but got a mild sando to be safe. I could've probably handled a hotter sandwich but it was still good. The chicken was crunchy but juicy and there was a really nice depth of flavor because of the spices.  The sandwich is also a moderate size.There wasn't much space to sit besides a bench outside the shop. No seating is inside. Most people seem to take there orders to go.I would come back if I was nearby again.

I always wanted to try it at their brick and mortar location in DTLA, but having a take-out and delivery option from Pasadena made it just so much more convenient and less time-consuming.My husband and I split the mild Luis and Sando 2.0 sandwiches with their crispy fries. The quality and the consistency of the tenderness with an equally distributed spice level with every bite wowed us. The cheese and bacon were decent ratios with the tenders. The slaw was slightly sweet and not too soggy. The fries were crispy despite the 20-minute commute it took to be delivered to my apartment. The aioli was delicious as well.I think this would have been a different experience had I tried the food while dining out rather than getting it delivered.

It's not a long drive, maybe 10-15 minutes. And so worth it.I got the mushroom and chicken crepe and their mushroom dumpling. I cannot spell the actual name of the dish, but it's amazing. The dishes are a perfect myriad for sauce, texture, quality, and flavor.It is a TAD expensive, but the food is more filling than you'd think. If you're not into dumplings or crepes, they have these farmer market pancakes that remind me of mini souffle pancakes and they also have desserts and pizza.

You walk in and stand in line to order from some really friendly people and you find a table either inside or outside. The vibe, much like the area it's located in, feels lively and bright.I feel like I ordered well, even though I'm not really familiar with the cuisine. I got the borscht, syrnyky (pancakes) with berries and custard, and the pelmeni chicken dumplings.I loved the comforting, earthy taste of the borscht. I'm a big fan of dill, which I believe it's an underrated herb, and it really shined in this dish. It came with some bread, slices of pork, and a side of sour cream. I really thought this was just really well done.The pancakes were great. There is almost a tart flavor to it and love the texture and the mix of flavors from the custard and berries.I'm a big fan of dumplings in any culture. The pelmeni were structurally sound and had great flavor. Super well cooked and lovely with the side of sour cream.I would say a tad bit on the pricey side, but overall just a great experience and great food.

The food and service are excellent; however, unless you live/work here, it's hard to visit due to the complete lack of parking onsite. You can use the guest parking at apartment complex: but they are always lacking and very compact. Once you get over ""getting here"", the food is fantastic. I am not an expert on Ukrainian or Eastern European food; I can't tell authentic from fake. But, the food here is tasty and sincere. I really really like it. Most of the food contains milk (cheese of some sort or sour cream). My Russian friends explain that is how you should enjoy home cooking. Hence, the reason it's not a five start is that it didn't match my flavor profile. But, when I got through the butter (I avoided the cheese and cream) I found fantastic flavors in the food. Even the simple potato dumplings elevated potato and mushroom flavors to the foreground: fantastic. And borscht; who doesn't love an intense soup.

Yes, please, ""Mom, Please!""Tucked away in a neighborhood apartment complex, the restaurant feels almost like stepping into a family home. Many of the clientele also seemed to be Ukrainian (and Russian-speaking). I ordered syrniki (cottage cheese pancakes) and medovik (Russian honey cake) to eat at the restaurant, and I bought some frozen potato varenyky to-go. I also ordered an iced lavender latte, which is by no means Ukrainian, but it was delicious: sweet, fragrant, and not too strong on the coffee flavor (which I like).The verdict:-- Syrniki (8/10): I'm personally not a huge fan of cottage cheese, but I was impressed by how smooth the inside was and enjoyed the crispy outside layer. Not too sweet, either.-- Medovik (10/10): I know it isn't Ukrainian, but I couldn't resist ordering this. I LOVE medovik, and ""Mom, Please"" did it so well: soft, slightly spongey layers with naturally-sweet honey and cream. I could eat slices of them!-- Potato varenyky (9.5/10): I bought them frozen and cooked them at home. So good! The dough was wonderfully al-dente, and I loved the simple, but flavorful potatoes and cheese inside. Only thing was that it was just a tad too salty, but otherwise delicious.Given that ""Mom, Please"" opened just months ago, the prices were expensive to keep up with quality and maintenance costs.

Not a very diverse clientele, but it seems family owned which is a plus. The clientele and the staff came off a bit rude, rushed, and cold, to my partner and I. Felt like we were looked at oddly a ton, nonetheless i this isn't an uncommon thing so I usually don't care but this felt a bit unwelcoming.Nonetheless, the food was pretty underwhelming, haven't tried everything on the menu so perhaps I just ordered something that didn't work for me however, once we were hurried into a chair - (mind you we did come 1 hour before closing) - however worked in food so I get it but... still. A warm hello and some eye contact would be cool.Anyhow we got the Borscht, Cherry Vareniky, Chicken Crapes.Food came out cold, which I'm not sure if this is how it's supposed to served here but - I like crapes or chicken... hot. The texture felt reheated and not too fresh. The temperature of it felt hotter in some areas than the other. Not it for me.This dish was served with sour cream which I dig, but I got the idea that that may be traditional which I respect. Just not for me.The Borscht, was probably the best thing we had out of the three, but even then it was pretty plain tasting and the meat was tough. I'm usually a huge fane of simple soups - it wasn't bad it was just lacking some kind of flavor... but what I did like about it was how it was simplified dish. Almost like a birria but stripped down.Also served with sour creamAnd for the Cherry Vareniky - idk - the texture of the encasing was a bit rubber and there just wasn't a rush of strong flavors.I was a bit sad because this place had ingredients mixed together that I had yet to see some in that way but when we got to it it just didn't hit.I appreciate being exposed to a different cultures food tho - I would want to try it out again but, I probably won't because of the atmosphere.","13151 Fountain Park Dr Playa Vista, CA 90094",4.8,108,"Pizza, Ukrainian, Breakfast & Brunch",$$

Their hummus was super smooth, creamy, and flavorful. The pita bread comes out freshly hot and soft. Their ginger ale was good and their Lilith mocktail was a nice elevated drink to the meal too. I thought the lamb flatbread and fattoush salad (slightly overdressed) were both good but didn't blow me away like the other dishes.Last but certainly not least, the oyster mushroom kebab with the avocado sauce was the best thing I've tried here.

I'm used to thick slices but this place slices the meat super thin, which was pretty interesting. We also ordered 청국장 (fermented soy bean paste) soup. Smell can be tough to handle if you are not used to old school traditional Korean food, but I personally really enjoyed it. Service was also great too. They have a button on the table that you can press whenever you need something.I think the highlight was their muk gul lee, which is traditional Korean rice wine. It came in like a stone jar and it tasted very delicious. They must brew their own because it didn't taste like those cheap commercial ones.Overall, I think this spot is a great option if you want to just chill, eat, and drink with friends and family.

142,2023-09-16,2023-09-17,Pine & Crane DTLA,"Got sad eating this - came here because I missed taiwan and this place really missed its mark. I was craving a simple taiwanese bfast that usually includes a rice roll (fan tuan), egg pancake (danbing), and cold soy milk.Purple rice roll was small, dry, and not sticking together well. Egg pancake was more doughy. Soy milk tasted rubbery and bland despite the sugar, which is a first.I think it's fun for small businesses to play with traditional menus from time to time, but I didn't think the purple rice and marinated egg was necessary in the rice roll. Neither was the corn in the egg pancake.","1120 S Grand Ave Ste 101 Los Angeles, CA 90015",4.6,420,Taiwanese,$$

There was tons of natural light and a breezy patio. The staff was very prompt with helping me and friendly.Here's what I ordered:Pan fried pork buns: fluffy buns with a nice crispy sear, and flavorful juicy pork inside. I just wish the meat to bread ratio was a little better. 8/10Beef rolls: the beef was tender and delicious. These were tasty overall but I wanted a bit more browning/crispness on the wrap and it needed a touch more hoisin sauce inside. 7.5/10Wood ear mushrooms: these were unfortunately a little lacking in flavor. Needed a bit more saltiness so it tasted a bit bland. 6/10Shrimp wontons: even though I got these to go, the wrappers still held up and the shrimp inside was still juicy and had a nice bite. The sauce was tangy and had great flavor. 8.5/10Dan Dan noodles: these were bland and I was disappointed. I tasted the sesame but found it overall lacking in flavor. It was definitely lacking in saltiness and umami. 6/10Overall there are some tasty items here, but some not so much. I wanted to like this place a lot more since I live so close by. It's a solid spot for the area if you order the right things, but it's just not as good  as the Chinese food from the 626","1120 S Grand Ave Ste 101 Los Angeles, CA 90015",4.6,420,Taiwanese,$$
142,2023-09-15,2023-09-17,Pine & Crane DTLA,"Stopped by for lunch with my dad and immediately loved the ambience-- such a cute and cozy outdoor courtyard with lots of lovely greenery. We came on a relatively quiet day, too, so food came out quickly and service was efficient. To my surprise everything here is extremely affordable, cheap, even!Regrettably, after seeing the food other people got, we did not order any appetizers. I got the Dan Dan noodles which were only $11 and definitely worth more! The noodles were nice chewy texture, and the sauce was smooth, garlicky, slightly spicy and sweet. The peanuts added a great crunch, and the cucumbers provided refreshment and perfect combination with the peanut sauce. I would have liked some more veggies in this dish because it was overall a bit rich; I make a similar dish at home with shredded carrots and bok choy which I think would have made good additions.My dad's wonton soup broth was clean and clear, yet quite flavorful. I enjoyed it in today's cool weather.We finished the meal with the traditional shaved ice with grass jelly (my favorite), little taro and sweet potato rice cakes, red bean, and boba! As a self-proclaimed boba connoisseur I was actually quite impressed with the balls and I bet they have an amazing bobarista in the back! The ice itself was way too sweet for me. As for the texture, it was a bit icy (I'm not sure if Taiwanese shaved ice is supposed to be that way) and not silky soft like Korean bingsu. The portion was HUGE-- definitely could have been shared by 4-5 people.I'm glad I finally got to try Pine + Crane-- great ambiance, great taste and even better prices.

142,2023-09-12,2023-09-17,Pine & Crane DTLA,"Wow, I really hate to do this but I had one of the worst experiences today at Pine and Crane. Came in expecting to get breakfast, granted I showed up at 11 which is when breakfast service ends and I was told breakfast was no longer being served. After I place my order for Dan Dan Noodles I overheard the manager offer another customer breakfast, didn't make a big deal out of it just sat and waited for my food. My order came out a couple of minutes later so one star for fast service (mind you they gave me no utensils, no napkins, no condiments) but I live literally next door and when I tasted my noodles I'm not lying when I say these noodles were literally still slightly refrigerated/lukewarm. So I do what any normal person would do and went back and asked for another order which they politely agreed to.However, when my food came out the manager asked me if I had ever had the noodles before, to which I replied yes I have. Then she proceeded to try to justify that the noodles are quoted a 10 minute ticket time but that they typically take 2-3 minutes to cook, to which I replied well I don't understand how that applies to this situation because I walked in and ordered to-go and received my food right away. She went on to try to explain that maybe between the time the food was packed and when I ate it got cold. Yet I've had fast food stay hotter over a longer period of time. I explained to her that food should always be served hot, bottom line. She then called me aggressive and hostile, and I said sure I am a little upset because of the aforementioned experience with breakfast as she kept saying ""yeah"" ""uh-huh"" in a very condescending tone.On top of that there was a filthy terry towel in plain sight where they place everyone's to go orders, which I made her aware of and I pointed out how gross and dirty all her furniture was, which she didn't like at all. Her workers then started to harass me and tell me I was being rude. So I apologized and took accountability for my behavior and asked her to do the same about her condescending tone, and she literally told me it was ""in response to my behavior"".Again. WOW.Maybe I was just hangry, but this place has taken a complete nosedive, and I'm pretty sure like I'm most cases it's due to poor management. Went home and had to microwave my noodles Top Ramen style.Good luck and God speed Pine and Crane.Wipe down your furniture but don't leave the dirty towel out for everyone to see once you're done.","1120 S Grand Ave Ste 101 Los Angeles, CA 90015",4.6,420,Taiwanese,$$

142,2023-09-10,2023-09-17,Pine & Crane DTLA,"I was in charge of selecting lunch for my group before going to an event in the LA Convention Center. I am honestly disappointed that this did not live up to the high ratings I have seen on Yelp and Google reviews.I ordered the pork pan fried pork buns, wok tossed eggplant and basil, and beef roll. The pan fried pork buns were not as juicy as other ones I've tried. I was expecting a lot of hot soup to pour out as a I nibble a piece of the dumpling. The wok tossed eggplant and basil dish was a bit better. It was some good flavors, but I can tell that the eggplant was not soaked enough longer to absorb flavors. Some aspects of the eggplant was blander than other parts. The beef roll was actually the one I was most excited for because I have been craving for it. It was the worse ones I've tried because there is a high cucumber to beef ratio so it felt more like a cucumber roll than a beef roll.The service is pretty good and the ambiance of the place is just like any DTLA establishment. I like the concept that you should order and pay first, especially when going with a large group! It saves a lot of mental math but honestly, with the food not living up to my expectations, it really made me feel disappointed.","1120 S Grand Ave Ste 101 Los Angeles, CA 90015",4.6,420,Taiwanese,$$

It was cold, about half popcorn and half Parmesan cheese...just piles of cheese. Weird, and not especially appetizing.Entrees: Mac and cheese - SO MUCH nutmeg. Not terrible if you like nutmeg, but weird. Seriously, SO MUCH.Blue cheese salad - a strange combination of toppings and a big pile of very weedy arugula with minimal dressing. Not bad, just eh.Jalapeño soup - it's not potato soup, it's a bowl of cream with added flavors and 2 small chunks of potato. The flavor was good, but it was really just like eating a bowl of flavored heavy cream.Dessert: churro waffle - I didn't think this could be messed up, but I was wrong. It seems like the waffles are SOAKED in a very sweet maple syrup, then cooked and covered in cinnamon and sugar. Daughter and I both thought they had a very strange flavor, we left more than half untouched.Out of coffee...no espresso and no coffee of any sort.

The broth was smooth and chickeny. The dumplings were so good I could have eaten a dozen of them alone. I was in chicken soup heaven. Next time I will try it with the fat noodles just because. Unfortunately,  my only gripe is that they use breast meat for the chicken, and it was tough, but I shoved it aside and devoured the rest of the yumminess. The queen d golden special. Lol!  oh, and I loved how the broth was packed separate from everything else.

The service was really fast and our food came out only a few minutes after ordering.We both ordered the spicy beef soup noodles and wow were they great. The beef was extremely tender and everything was so tasty. It was a bit on the salty side but I still really enjoyed me dish. It was quite large and lasted me two meals.There is only street parking, which can be tough as it is located on a street with a dead end.

Pork filling was so-so, marinade is heavy on the cooking wine. I've had better frozen dumplings tbh.Chengdu Zajiang Noodles (4/5): We enjoyed the level of spice and numbness but it was pretty oily.Spare Rib Noodles (1/5): Awful. I get that Szechuan cuisine is heavy on the oil but this was smothered in a half inch layer of oil. We could barely taste anything besides oil. Rice noodles were undercooked, but also weren't rinsed with cool water after cooking so they were really sticky. Spare ribs were tender but didn't have much meat on them.During the meal we realized this was the same chain as the San Gabriel location and both are equally lackluster. Unfortunately I really doubt that any Szechuan food enthusiast would recommend this spot.","5263 W Adams Blvd Los Angeles, CA 90016",4.2,385,"Chinese, Noodles",$$

I am so happy they reopened after closing during the pandemic.We had the steak tartare, diver scallops, duck liver, soba with shitake, pork jowl, cavatelli pasta with crabs and pecorino cheese. Everything was great including the sour cream panacotta dessert, which was heavenly. Side bread was also good i had to ask for more (Extra bread was $3 though, which I felt was unnecessary). Most outstanding were the steak tartare, pork jowl, and sour cream panacotta with blueberries.I would definitely come back for the cheeseburger available only during the 8:30-10pm happy hour, it looked very scrumptious.Heck even the bathroom was beautiful & clean, and kept clean too.Minus 1 star cause of two things:1) 4% ""kitchen love"" mandatory fee is ridiculous; it insinuates we're lousy tippers. The $3 for extra 2-small pieces bread, again, isn't so cool too.2) Portioning was too small, it's like a serving a bunny lol!","3901 W 6th St Los Angeles, CA 90020",4.0,587,"American (New), Cocktail Bars",$$$

Standouts to me were the beef tartare (savory flavor especially with the aioli spread) and the yellowtail collar! Also loved the scallops.Service was wonderful! Our server was very attentive.I just wish everything I ordered doubled in size as that to me would have matched up with the cost of each dish (hence 2 stars off for lack in value and for leaving me hungry). I think in order to feel adequately satiated, you would need to spend $80-100 on dishes  per person (not including tip, not including drinks).I still recommend trying this place but perhaps only go for a light meal!","3901 W 6th St Los Angeles, CA 90020",4.0,587,"American (New), Cocktail Bars",$$$

146,2023-08-15,2023-09-17,Here's Looking At You,"The food and drinks were really good, but the portions? Not so much. I understand that it's a shared small-plates restaurant, but it breaks my heart a little to pay $28 for really thinly sliced hamachi on a plate the size of my hand.I came here mainly for the duck liver and steak tartare, and both were on point with the seasoning and flavors.- Steak tartare: The spices in this gave the dish an extra crispy kick to it that tartares usually miss out on, which was really nice. The steak itself was really soft and really easy to eat by the spoonful and spreading it on the bread, which was also really good.- Duck liver with chips: Their newest iteration (no longer with bread). I really liked the coconut caramel glaze they put on top, but I wish there was more duck liver so that I don't have to skimp when I'm spreading it on the chips.- Tsukune: A little less seasoned and a little more bouncy/chewy (like fish balls) than I would have liked.- Hamachi: The flavors didn't really meld together for some reason, and I could only taste the hamachi even though it was seasoned with fresh herbs, cucumbers, and aguachile.The cocktails matched up with the better food items really well:- Ratio Me 1:1: The melon foam was slightly too sweet, and needed the drink to balance it out. It was really good still.- That Sh*t Bussin': This tasted like Thai coconut curry in a good way. A tiny bit spiced, coconutty, and satisfyingly savory while still sweet.A note about pacing: I was slightly disappointed that the tsukune came out 1 minute after the steak tartare, so there was a sacrifice in taste when we ate the room-temperature tsukune since we wanted to eat the tartare with the bread when it was still warm and crispy. Maybe I'm being a little picky, but I wanted to taste everything at it's best.A lot of other reviewers would agree by saying that the portions are really small, and I would suggest the restaurant to take in the feedback since their menu changes daily, meaning that things can change based off of customer feedback. Their servers are really nice, but I wish their small business would take in the feedback that I've been seeing quite consistently across reviewers.","3901 W 6th St Los Angeles, CA 90020",4.0,587,"American (New), Cocktail Bars",$$$

It's a bit on the pricer side as our toppings came out to 6.49.. if you dine in you can get as many toppings as you want but beware the price is by weight. our total came out to 36.99 no drinks included for our main dish and side.We got spicy level two and for me it was the perfect amount of spice if you can handle it.

The move top was nice, surrounded by many hedges, and to be expected many people over a typical Los Angeles scene. Although it seem like it could be a nice place to grab a drink at, The food was not as good as I expected it to be in pricey. The tuna tartare was probably the best thing on the limited menu, price at $38. They have a limited selection of pizza. You can order at the rooftop as well that are not listed on the menu, and tonight they had a lemon pizza. It was different and tasty, lemon, slightly overpowering, but the pizza was burnt, and there were some parts of it you really couldn't eat. We ordered one of the focaccias as well, and it was way too salty, and possibly a little too oily, although it was fluffy. Lastly, we ordered the Arancini, just be sure to know it has ham in it, which we didn't realize. It's funny for such a nice place that at the bottom of the Arancini plate they put almost Pizza Hut Parmesan sprinkles. The music was loud, rap music, and as much as I love rap music, it didn't really seem to go with the place and almost made it seem like the place was trying to hard. At max, I would return here for a drink, but I was otherwise unimpressed, and didn't see the hype compared to all the other great places LA has to offer. As a sidenote, they said the rooftop would have a view, and I wouldn't really count it as much of a view.","9388 S Santa Monica Blvd Beverly Hills, CA 90210",4.0,121,"Italian, Bars",$$$$

Chi Chi LA is a restaurant like no other, offering an extraordinary blend of dining and entertainment.The atmosphere on a weekend night is positively vibrant and bustling. The reason? Well, it's all thanks to the special feature at every table - the personal ordering devices. These nifty gadgets aren't just for placing your food orders; they're a gateway to a world of fun and games.Each table has its own ordering device, which not only allows you to select your dishes but also provides a variety of interactive games. You can enjoy mini-games by yourself or challenge other tables. There are even spontaneous group challenges initiated by the restaurant. Plus, there's a chat room where you can strike up conversations with diners at other tables.Now, onto the food. Chi Chi LA offers a tasty menu, though portions are on the smaller side. The flavors are delightful, and I highly recommend trying their flavored Soju cocktails. They come with eye-catching glowing lights and adorable duck decorations that add a cute touch to your dining experience.The only drawback is that engaging in conversation can be a bit challenging due to the continuous sounds of excitement from people playing games all around you.

There is a back outdoor patio to hang out while you wait to get seated inside and also a bar too. The cool thing about this place is there is a tablet on each table and you can play against another table for drink/bottle of your choice and if you win they pay for it. There are also some claw machine games too! Service was okay had to ask multi times for things.,"610 S Berendo St Los Angeles, CA 90010",4.3,50,"Korean, Bars",

There's an outdoor waiting area, upstairs with claw machines, and lower bottom area. Each table has a tablet for you to order drinks, food, and play games for prizes. You can chat with other tables and play games to win drinks. The concept is different and the atmosphere is very clubby.

The tablet games are interactive-- you can play games with other tables (KEEP IN MIND YOURE BETTING ON REAL MENU ITEMS so if you lose you're paying for that bargained item that's going to another table). So you're basically gambling while getting drunk, worst combo ever lolMy advice is to go towards the end of their happy hour, order most of the alcohol for your party (for half the prices) and find a good seat and let the fun beginsThey also host an all-tables interactive game every now and then for everyone to play, and winner gets prizes!Great place to drink, listen to loud music, meet friends","610 S Berendo St Los Angeles, CA 90010",4.3,50,"Korean, Bars",

The food was edible but nothing to rave about. This place is a drinking establishment that had loud EDM music on a Friday night. I don't mind EDM, but it would have been nice to have a mixture of EDM music or different DJ sets. This establishment is basically catered to the younger crowd...Now... onto the staff. The staff here are the worst ever. Rude rude rude... I can't believe someone would hire such rude people. If it's our first time, please take the time to explain to us how to order. If there is a discrepancy on the bill, be courteous enough to respond without attitude. I asked what the 16.99 for Seoro was for on my bill. They said it was for games. First off, 1 game should not be 16.99 and Seoro is soju... So I paid for a bottle of soju I never got. Anyways, I just paid it and left. I won't ever be back here!

I specifically wanted Huevos Rancheros and since I saw them in the yelp menu photos I was pretty happy they offered them and the place had great reviews. When I arrived I asked for them and was told that they do not have them, nor had they ever served them..that maybe I confused the restaurant with another of similar name. But no, it's on their yelp.

155,2023-09-03,2023-09-17,Rosaline,"Rosaline is fairly energy-filled two-room restaurant that generally boasts different vibes depending on whether you are dining inside or in their inside garden. I usually prefer the garden although inside you can watch the kitchen do their magic. Having said that, if you join Rosaline for a meal be prepared to be sitting as close t your fellow diners as you can imagine, and participate in side bar conversations around you as they get louder and louder with the drinks progressing.I love their bar but find their cocktails to be unimaginative and bland. Even classic cocktails are not properly represented so I prefer to skip them.Food-wise, given the Peruvian theme of the restaurant there are tons of ceviches. Some are nice, but the ceviche crocante for example is pretty poor and delivered like a surrealist painting where the artist dropped a bunch of ingredients otherwise intended for different appetizers on a large plate. The dressing and zest in it was also under- and over-powering at the same time. I also disliked the coquettes but mostly because of their generalized unseasonedness.The octopus - despite traditionally a favorite dish of mine, here probably wins the spot of worst-in-town. It was overcooked but not in a chewy way; rather, it was an extra dose mushy. The tentacle had similar texture to Haribo gummy bears, so we left 2/3 of it.The scallops were probably the best dish of the bunch, and I thought the toasted quinoa on top with the sauce worked really well. Though again as before, they were a bit overcooked as well.In the end, while I have at previous visits enjoyed the family style paella, I would probably stop going to Rosaline. I had quite the underwhelming experience, service, and ended up getting a check with 20% tip automatically added, so maybe that's why service is a bit low-effort type.","8479 Melrose Ave West Hollywood, CA 90069",3.9,1131,"Peruvian, Cocktail Bars",$$$
155,2023-08-27,2023-09-17,Rosaline,"I love Peruvian food, I got to know it well in the 6 years I lived there. I was very excited for the chaufa paella and greatly disappointed when I got to experience it. Presentation was great, service was good, this dish was so Smokey in flavor I thought I was eating campfire tinder. I understand that one of the ingredients on it was bagoong, it's a fermented fish paste... our dish must have been lathered in it. O don't mind a little bit of Smokey flavor in my meals, but that was all we were able to taste. I almost always leave a plate clean, and if I don't leave it clean, I take the rest to go. Left more than half of this plate, I didn't take anymore home and expressed to our waitress it was so insanely Smokey it was inedible for both my partner and I. For a $49 dish I thought it was insulting, let alone the lack of care and attention when asked about the dish and informed our waitress that it was insanely smokey and rough on the palate. This occurred Friday 8/26 and our reservation was for 6:30pm, Rosaline was not busy by this time.The drinks were good, the paiche (jungle trout) was pretty good, and the atmosphere was lovely... I enjoyed basking under all the plants. However, the chaufa was rough, not sure if I could return here looking to enjoy an authentic Peruvian dish, and I'd humbly suggest the chef be informed of this if he wasn't the night we dined there.","8479 Melrose Ave West Hollywood, CA 90069",3.9,1131,"Peruvian, Cocktail Bars",$$$

The tapas were alright, lots of random options like scallops with cheese (nice presentation but interesting combo of flavors that I wouldn't expect together) or olives or peppers etc. that don't seem that appetizing for filling. The grilled octopus was a tiny serving for the price. Paella was not as traditional as other options I've had in California but definitely saved the meal for us in terms of flavor and portions; but it took about 50 minutes. The service was super spotty even though they automatically include a 20% service charge for parties of any size. Took about 15 min for a server to bring us water and even greet us after we were seated, then halfway through our server changed after a long time without any attention. This spot is definitely somewhere you come for the ambiance/decor but not so much for the food or experience of dining.","8479 Melrose Ave West Hollywood, CA 90069",3.9,1131,"Peruvian, Cocktail Bars",$$$

This would have been OK if we had received a 20% tip worthy service. But we didn't because the server knew he is receiving a 20% tip no matter what kind of service he provides.

The sauce on the tomahawk pork chop katsu is a little to sweet for my taste. The rose Seoul night Tteok Ppoki is a yummy bowl of comfort, it has a combination of rice cakes, dumplings, fish cakes and noodles in a mildly spicy creamy gochujang sauce.  I've noticed a lot of different restaurants by chef Kang  come and go,  I hope this place stays!","3377 Wilshire Blvd Ste 209 Los Angeles, CA 90010",4.2,94,"Gastropubs, Korean",

There were complimentary tortilla chips dusted in sugar (a bit too sweet for me) with pico de gallo. The pico was not fresh and was underwhelming. I'd give 3 stars for the octopus. It was plated beautifully, but the sauce and accompanying ingredients were not fresh. The cheese corn was just an oval iron skillet with sweet corn and melted cheese - not worth the price.Ambience - for me, 2 stars. It was not particularly welcoming and too dark inside. I sat outside, a bit better.Service - 3 stars. There was only one other table occupied, server was a bit slow.I went during the week at an off-peak time.

The location has a cool concept with multiple dining rooms. We sat on the side that would be considered, possibly more family style oriented based off of the color scheme in the larger tables. The other dining area may be geared more towards more of a outside ambience starlight Ambience the way that it is designed. They have these very unique chips and salsa and the chips have a little sugar sprinkled on them, as this gives off a very fragrant flavorful vibe with the salsa.

However it was already late night nearing midnight, and many KBBQ places couldn't serve us due to the time. Eventually we walked into Woo Hyang Woo and they were still accepting late walk-ins! We were a party of 9, but even with a large group they were able to get us seated quickly and we ended up getting a whole room to ourselves which felt like special treatment!My group split into two different tables. For my table we ordered one of the Woo Hyang Woo Combo D which came with Prime Beef Brisket, Prime Boneless Short Ribs, Prime Boneless Ribeye, and we chose to get the Prime Beef Bulgogi. All the meats were delicious and I liked the banchan that was offered. I think the other table group ordered 2 different combos as well.The service here was also some of the best I've experience in all of Koreatown. The young guy who sat us here had a likeable personality and felt relatable. We also mentioned about the promotion of leaving a yelp review for free soju, and in turn he gave us two free soju bottles for each table. And even though we were trying to cook the KBBQ meats ourselves, the staff offered to do it for us which was nice.All in all, I really like Woo Hyang Woo. I've only tried a couple of KBBQs in Koreatown, but so far this one is my favourite for the time being.

A few of the sides were really solid too. The protein dishes are more substantial and thereby best to go in groups and share. Be prepared to spend a bit. Recommend sitting in the patio!Details: we had a group of 6 guys and details below on what we ordered. We had a ton of leftovers.. for sure only needed one of the protein dishes, but still happy we tried both. If you had to do one, try the short rib if it's your first time. Potatoes and tomatoes were great. Bings were good, just a bit pricey for what it is. Oysters were very average.1) short rib (pre-order needed): definitely the star of the show! Smoked bone in, carved table side. Great flavor and quality bbq. Leftover carvings were used to then make fried rice. Accoutrements were pretty average. Expensive at $235, but does feed 4-5. Recommend for a special occasion if it's your first time!2) smoked bo ssam (pork shoulder): really great flavor, smokey and sweet. To me it was like high quality pulled pork with asian inspired flavors. Good for sharing.3) crispy potatoes: perfect pairing for the proteins to add some carbs. We ordered two of these4) heirloom tomatoes: super fresh and sweet, balanced perfectly with the sesame vinaigrette. They served this dish as appetizer, would have preferred to have this with the meat to help cut the fat a bit.5) bings: had the butter/honey and the ricotta/compote. Really really good.. freshly griddled bing paired and the dips were both really good. Assuming u are already there to splurge, I'd say get two to try.6) oysters: while fresh, nothing really stood out. Would have expected maybe a bit more at $26 for half dozen.All in all, recommend trying if you haven't been and go in a group!","1725 Naud St Los Angeles, CA 90012",4.2,1363,"American (New), Asian Fusion, Korean",$$$

And, then covid caused all that pause!So, I was coming back to LA for a weekend trip, and I thought to give it another try. Asked a friend if he wanted to join, and both of us finally made it to Majordomo!Got reservation relatively easily a couple of days before, thankfully, and the place was packed on the Friday night!!And, then we started ordering things - from a bottle of sake to some starting dishes like tuna tataki and their famous bing flatbread (with bone marrow of course), and the crispy potatoes (a fun tip: eat these potatoes with the bone marrow dip and maybe add a tiny bit of that kimchi sauce that comes with oysters.. so yum ;)) Oh, and the clay pot rice - we got the duck one!! So yum! And, the pork! And, had to finish with pavlova! Gotta visit again!Also, our server asked which one we would give a higher rating - momofuku vegas vs. majordomo LA.. both are amazing! But, momofuku vegas wins for me!","1725 Naud St Los Angeles, CA 90012",4.2,1363,"American (New), Asian Fusion, Korean",$$$
159,2023-08-24,2023-09-17,Majordomo,"I've generally had a decent experience at Majordomo for many reasons. I have been there a total of three times and I can tell one thing for sure is the consistency in the good service and ambiance. Everybody is very friendly and accommodating. I remember arriving early my first time and I was given a nice seat m at the bar where I ordered one of my favorite lemon ginger shiso mocktails before my party arrived.I also remember every one of our servers being very knowledgeable about the menu and being helpful with what to choose in terms of cocktails, appetizers, entrées, and desserts. The ambience from the open floor plan makes it very interactive and lively with all the tables filled with people, and sometimes close enough where you can have conversations with people next to you. We remember talking to our neighbor and sharing ideas over which dessert to share and I found that to be super fun and memorable.A number of things stand out from the menu at Majordomo. Off the top of my head I can confidently say that the Bing bread (or Chinese flatbread) is one of the most unique types of bread I've ever tried. We have ordered it every time and it's never disappointed. It's very difficult to choose something other than the butter and truffle honey but I hope that one day I can muster up the courage to try the other sides it comes with.The mushroom fried rice is a delicious entree with a very cool presentation as the server cracks the crusted layer of the rice and mixes it in front of you. Very flavorful.We had a subpar experience last time when we ordered the wagyu steak and did not at all have real wagyu steak in front of us. It was one of the worst experiences we've had with steak before. The meat was extremely chewy - so much that we needed to cut them up into diced cubes to be able to enjoy them. It would have been a choking hazard had we tried to eat them in the slices that had arrived in. Horrible experience. We told the server who was very empathetic and relayed the message to the chef. We got our cocktails taken care of. We will never order it again which was a shame since the marination was delicious.I had been told multiple times by servers in my prior visits that the chickpea mac and cheese is their popular one. We decided to order it and it was actually just alright. Nothing to write home about.The kimchi pasta was a decent plate which was taken off their menu the last time. The fries and steak in my past visits were also much better.If you're looking for something decent, you won't be disappointed here. Unfortunately the quality of the food has not been consistent enough for me to want to return anytime soon.PARKING:Valet across the alley or street parking","1725 Naud St Los Angeles, CA 90012",4.2,1363,"American (New), Asian Fusion, Korean",$$$

Our server who was very nice and well mannered got my omelette order wrong. I had two bites of the omelette when I noticed that it was missing the mushrooms that I ordered to come with the omelette. No biggie I mentioned to my waitress and she said that she would bring the mushrooms on the side. I said no i prefer to have them cooked with the omelette. She said she would remove the order from check. I said please don't just make another one for me please and remove the one I got from my check. After about 10-15 minutes the correct omelette was brought to me. It was very good and delicious. After I ate half of my omelette with mushrooms i request for the check.The manager came by to ring up my check. I guess they must of misunderstood me because I noticed in my check that they charged me for two omelettes! I told the manager that they got my order wrong on the first omelette and requested to have them make another one. He said well you almost ate all of the first one so that is why I am charging you for that one as well. I told him I took two bites from the omelette plus the omelette there are European size. 3 big bites and the omelette is gone. He answered with a typical French attitude. He made a smirk and removed the first omelette from my charge. FYI they automatically charge 18% gratuity on your check. I told him if that I don't mind paying for the first omelette but I don't think it is fair. He said no it's fine . I went ahead and added to the extra tip for the omelette I ate in the beginning. Will I come back NO.

They also add a 20% service charge even though you're not getting the kind of service that rate should offer.This is one of those places that people are flocking to because social media got a hold of it.

I selected the French Toast with berries, diced potatoes and iced coffee. It taste good-thicc, soft, and warm; not too overwhelming in sweetness or flavor. Iced coffee was modest.

I originally came here to try their ramen, but their sushi caught me by surprise and exceeded my expectations. Their ramen is also very good (got the garlic black tonkatsu). Their noodles, especially, remind me of Ichiran's noodles -- thin but bouncy.

This restaurant is incredible from the personalized service by the Manager, Brody, and his staff, to the amazing creative stylings of Chef Jeffrey.Don't consider this a ""ramen"" restaurant even though they offer it. What they really excel at is sushi. There wasn't one dish I saw pass by our table that I wouldn't want to try. Our Omakasi experience was off the charts and featured unusual fishes (and a Wagu course) with amazing preparations. Chef Jeffrey is truly inspired and the $150.00 per plate fee was a steal...especially after we paid $250.00 to sit at a table at Morihiro for an ""ok"" experience that cost $700.00 out the door (It's $400.00 to sit at the bar). We felt ripped off. The only negative I can offer is that the restaurant is EXTREMELY noisy with lots of hard surfaces...very difficult to have a conversation unless you're screaming. A good tip is to ask for a table outdoors so you can hear yourself think.We will be coming back to Iki Ramen for many more Omakasi experiences!","6565 Sunset Blvd Los Angeles, CA 90028",4.8,106,"Ramen, Sushi Bars",

It was one of the hottest days this week too so it was quite warms and unpleasant. Another thing to note was that we did not have set server. So for the first 30 mins of being seated, we didn't have anyone come check on us and we're just cooking in the sun with no water. Eventually we waved down some other server and they came by to tell us they'll get our server.We then asked to move tables because ours wasn't cover and they were able to relocate us to the table under the plant canopy. One thing to note was that there wasn't much airflow so that area was quite stuffy. We then again, had to wave someone down to take our order because we didn't have a set server at the new table. It was quite unorganized and made the meal more uncomfortable and unwelcoming.After ordering, our food took a while to arrive maybe 30+ minutes. At the time the restaurant was quite empty as it was already 2PM. The dishes were interesting part of the chefs brunch. Portions are pretty small though, almost like tapas or for like 2 bites. They all had many ingredients which was interesting, some went well better than others. Half way through the meal, someone from our group wasn't feeling well so they needed to rest, luckily there was space but the staff rarely came over and when they did they approached us with a cold shoulder almost trying to kick us out and not offer any support to help. We stayed for a while until our friend felt better, and there was no one around us. When we did left on of the servers approached us very aggressively and spoke to us in a very condescending way. I understand the frustrating but there was definitely a nicer way to approach the situation.Food -- 7/10 small portions, a lot of different flavors some worked better than othersService -- 1/10 rude, non attentive, unapproachable, hostile toneAmbiance (daytime) -- 6/10 it was okay, there's an open roof, but a lot of plants blocking the view and tables are a bit cramped and music a bit too loud","813 Flower St Los Angeles, CA 90017",3.6,611,"American (New), Cocktail Bars, Tiki Bars",$$$

Super juicy!Kimchi Shrimp: it was a cold shrimp dish that was served with garlic and onions in a kimchee type dressing. First time trying this type of dish but it was straight GAS! SO GOOD! Solid balance, garlic and onions weren't over powering.I saved this restaurant on Yelp. You should do the same. I'll be back for sure.

164,2023-09-09,2023-09-17,Tlayuda L.A. Restaurant,"In the ever-echoing chambers of my mind, the eternal question reverberates, ""What the hell am I in the mood for?"" As I sift through the tapestry of tastes I've encountered, the sultry allure of Mexican beckons. Tacos from a street vendor? The hearty embrace of a burrito? Or perhaps the underrated charm of a torta? But then, a voice, dripping with sarcasm, chimes in, ""Sure, but which Mexico are you talking about?"" It's a gentle reminder of the vast culinary landscape of Mexico, divided into seven distinct regions: Norteño, Bajacaliforniano, Chipas, Jaliscense, Yucateco, Veracruzano, and Oaxaqueño. Each with its own heartbeat, its own soul. Today, my culinary compass pointed towards tlayudas - Oaxaca's misunderstood masterpiece, often dubbed the ""Oaxacan Pizza.""Tlayuda Los Angeles, a place where the art of tlayuda-making is revered, was my chosen sanctuary. I settled on their ""Tlayuda Supreme,"" a symphony of flavors on an expansive toasted corn tortilla canvas, adorned with bean puree, fresh greens, and a trinity of meats - Tasajo beef, cesina pork, and the fiery chorizo.But let's get one thing straight - calling this a pizza is like calling a Stradivarius a fiddle. It's closer in spirit to a tostada or an open-faced taco. The tlayuda I had was a revelation. A dish steeped in Oaxacan tradition, its foundation is a tortilla, crisped to perfection. It's then painted with refried black beans, layered with greens, and crowned with Oaxacan cheese and a medley of grilled meats. A splash of salsa, a sprinkle of fresh herbs, and you're on a journey. Some might fold it, letting the cheese melt in a warm embrace, while others, like me, prefer it open, in all its glory. And to wash it down? A gulp of mezcal or, in my case, a refreshing mint cucumber lemonade.So, the next time the siren song of Mexican food calls, ask yourself, ""Which corner of Mexico am I yearning for?"" Today, it was Oaxaqueño, with its tantalizing tlayuda. And the warmth of Tlayuda Los Angeles? It felt like coming home to a family I never knew I had. Pure magic.","5450 Santa Monica Blvd Los Angeles, CA 90029",4.6,858,Mexican,$$

During the summer, it can get really busy, but during normal times of the year, you can really feel The Canyon's ambiance in respect to this cafe. I came to this spot for brunch and we were seated quickly through their online waiting list which I think is very technologically efficient as it allowed for us to get in a walk around the beautiful neighborhood until our food was ready.My server was very kind throughout our meal and patiently came back to our table a few times until we were ready since it took us a bit to begin ordering. I ordered the Classic French Toast which had strawberries and powdered sugar on it in addition to a Nutella Iced Latte. I originally thought the portions for the french toast were a little small for the price, but it was surprisingly filling. I would definitely recommend this for a brunch meal. The Nutella flavored latte, however, I would not recommend as it did not taste like Nutella or hazelnut and rather not that pleasantly flavored at all. I did unfortunately feel like that purchase was a waste.At the end of the day, the external environment and internal ambiance makes this cafe worth a visit for a brunch meal, but one shouldn't expect the highest of food/drink quality.","2695 N Beachwood Dr Los Angeles, CA 90068",4.1,758,"American (New), Breakfast & Brunch",$$

Their coffee is not my favorite unfortunately, but their pastries are perfectly made.

166,2023-09-05,2023-09-17,Beachwood Cafe,"Love this place so much. Tied with Met Her At A Bar for my favorite Eggs Benedict in Los Angeles. We had a wonderful breakfast this Labor Day weekend. Beachwood is located in the Hollywood Hills and really has beautiful surroundings. If you're lucky enough to sit near a window, like we did, you will have plenty of views of the houses, hills, and passersbys. They have a large, free, parking lot in the back of the restaurant and we were able to find space there for a 10:30AM Sunday brunch. We got lucky with our arrival time so were able to be seated as soon as we arrived. Our server Jennifer G did a great job and was very attentive.As mentioned they have one of my favorite Eggs Benedicts' in LA. The hollandaise is seasoned well, the eggs were perfect, and they all sit on a Texas toast which really adds to the flavor and allows you to soak up the egg. We also order Caramel Lattes which I would highly recommend, the Avocado Toast as a share plate which was fantastic due to the labneh below the avocado, and also the Berry Pancakes, which were a hit as well.Overall one of my favorite breakfast spots in LA. I love how hidden and out of the way it is. It really feels like a place for LA locals like me; there didn't seem to be a large tourist crowd like some other locations have.

At the end of our meal, we needed takeout boxes and a takeout cup, which she slammed on the table while walking away & left the Coffee (takeout) Cup's lid open. Which made me question if she wanted us to spill the coffee. Towards the end of our meal, we felt as if she was only asking us ""customer service"" questions to rush us out of the restaurant (which we didn't take very long).

Everything else we ordered with our server, Kelly, who was warm friendly, and checked on us frequently was absolutely delicious!The pizza itself - oh, that pizza! It's got a nice thick crust with a slathering of tomato sauce - and as I write this, my mouth is totally watering! The crust has a curious flavor to it, almost along the lines of sourdough.

The creamy risotto inside a perfectly fried shell. The mozzarella core was such a pleasant surprise.bonus - the marinara sauce on the side HAD to have been made in house. I particularly appreciated the slight acidity that makes this sauce unique.Calamari - your above average restaruant calamari. Enjoyable, crispy but a little salty for my taste.Traditional Deep Dish Pizza - before I say anything else, I enjoyed this pizza.  That being said, the crust is a lot thicker than more authentic Chicago style pizzas. Often times above said crust goes toppings and cheese, then a large heaping of sauce. Given the sauce, I was most excited for this. But because the crust was so thick, I felt that the other elements were not only out of order, but lacking in amount. I particularly questioned the choice of having one large patty of sausage placed atop the pizza because it would often slide off.

I went about a month ago and then 2 days ago thinking that maybe a month ago they were just having a bad rush day but when I went 2 days ago, it was just as bad. I don't know if they changed the cooks or if it was busy so they didn't really focus on timing but it was not good at all. I got the salmon and shrimp plate. My salmon was beyond dry, ridiculously dry. I could tell as soon as I opened the container. The salmon was hard in certain pieces, it wasn't burnt but very very over cooked. The plating was very nice but it was difficult to eat the salmon because of the dryness and hard pieces. I've never had this issue except for the last 2xs that I visited here. And I always get the same thing and both times I was very disappointed.It's disheartening because I spend $100 there easily every time I go and I expect to get quality food for spending that amount every time. My husband and son also got a plate but chicken and steak. The chicken was just as dry as the salmon.I'm unclear what's going on the last few visits but I don't think I'll be returning any time soon. There are a few Hibachi restaurants around so I may have to try another spot from here on.I would recommend maybe try something small first instead of getting a plate because you don't want to spend a lot of money on something that's not cooked to perfection.","1045 S Hill St Los Angeles, CA 90015",3.9,390,"Steakhouses, Seafood, Teppanyaki",$$

Note, however, that a 5% kitchen fee will be tacked onto your bill.CONS:* Food was pedestrian across many courses. Nothing stood out. I hope you like black garlic because it's seemingly on every dish.* Ambiance is meh. They did, however, have a little Michelin tire man statue at the entrance to remind everyone that they're in a Michelin star-rated restaurant. Classy.* Both my partner and I had...shall we say...gastrointestinal distress a couple of hours after the meal.  Can't pinpoint what might have caused this, but the yellowtail and duck both seemed ""off"" at the time of eating.It's disappointing enough to pay Michelin star prices for food that's not at a Michelin star level in originality, ingredients or preparation.It's an absolute travesty to pay Michelin star prices for food that may be a health hazard.Can't recommend.","5722 Melrose Ave Los Angeles, CA 90038",4.3,748,American (New),$$$$

172,2023-08-19,2023-09-17,Kali Restaurant,"While I appreciate the efforts of the staff at Kali, the $175** seasonal tasting menu left a lot to be desired. Aside from a pretty tasty mixed seafood appetizer, freshly-baked bread, and a genuinely delightful salted egg ice cream, the other dishes missed the mark and honestly would have been below average at even half of what was charged. The scallop ""ceviche"" was overly salty and lacked the usual acidity, and the cheesy black truffle risotto, while rich in flavor, was also heavy on the salt. The main, a tiny strip steak, was tough and bland.Service was attentive, but there were moments when the timing felt off - my server kept asking my opinion of the food while I was still chewing the first bite, making it rather hard to provide immediate feedback.Another oddity was that their tasting menu dishes seemed to be taken directly from their a la carte menu, without a package discount. Had I known this I would've chosen a different set. And the absence of tap water meant an extra $8 and change for bottled.**That's including their ""5% kitchen appreciation charge"" which was annoying back when restaurants had their COVID surcharges, and it's still annoying now. If it's anything other than tax or a service charge in lieu of gratuity just include it in the price please!","5722 Melrose Ave Los Angeles, CA 90038",4.3,748,American (New),$$$$

We opted for the seasonal tasting menu $165/person, an add order of their beef tartare cigar $18, and of course couple glasses of wine.The standout dishes for me was the first dish, the crowded beach, which was visually beautiful and the last dish, the gelato. The gelato was the best gelato i have ever had in my life - rich, creamy, with some bites being slightly salty from the egg yolk shaved on top.The in between dishes  such as the gnocchi, new york steak, and scallop were decent but all quite forgetable. The beef tartare cigar definitely tasted unique but I didnt want more than a bite of it.Of course, the standout dishes for my bf was everything. He loves this place!Ambiance is hip and casual. Service wise, nothing special- we got seated, no smiles, got introduced our dish, got our checks, and got thanked on the way out.Overall, it was an okay experience.I would come back but order individual dishes the next time!

174,2023-08-30,2023-09-17,LA Rose Cafe,"LA Rose Cafe is apparently a legendary Filipino eatery in LA. I'll never know. I called ahead to get a reservation for 4, only to have us wait over 2 hours in the heat, on the sidewalk. We looked forward to trying their food, so we were as patient as we could be. Every time I checked in with the front hosts, I was met with poor attitude from the host/owner. Servers avoided eye contact with everyone and did not engage any inquiries - they did look overworked. Phrases like ""We're doing our best, but understand we don't have enough seats"" are acceptable enough, but what isn't acceptable is confirming a reservation they never intended to honor. When I confronted the host with this conflict, he angrily asked me what I'd like him to do, and I asked if we could be seated soon since we waited a long time. This request exasperated him - I understand the stress, but again, if he doubted he could seat us at all, he could've said so in the beginning when we first checked in, and rejected the reservation request over the phone even earlier - instead of telling me to show up on time and have our party wait for hours outside. After this rude encounter, we left soon after and went to Barrio Fiesta, which IS a solid and legendary Filipino eatery in Glendale. I want to support my fellow Filipinos and their businesses, but LA Rose Cafe made that difficult.","4749 Fountain Ave Los Angeles, CA 90029",4.2,1185,Filipino,$$
174,2023-08-28,2023-09-17,LA Rose Cafe,"The usual place where we get Filipino food is quite far, so we decided to try this place out.  Here's my honest personal opinion on this place, based on my own experience.Food: 2/5.  Nothing special.  The food were just OK, but the serving size is small, compared to the other Filipino restaurant that we go to.Price: 2/5.  Not too expensive, but way more expensive compared to, again, the place where we used to go to.Service:  3/5.  A little slow, specially considering that there was only one family in there, other than us.In short, we were not impressed with this place.  Next time we're in the area, I think I would rather drive the distance so I can enjoy better Filipino food, at a cheaper price.","4749 Fountain Ave Los Angeles, CA 90029",4.2,1185,Filipino,$$

175,2023-09-11,2023-09-17,Barra Santos,"Went there to check out this new spot. I sat at the bar solo and the lady that sat me wasn't the most warm person. They're more interested in following their own rules, than taking care of new clientele and marking sure they're happy and wanna come back. The server was polite but tried to force a couple of stupid rules on me. I told him that I m gonna order a couple of apps then I ll see if I wanna order more food. He said they prefer if I order everything right away, which I know it would help the kitchen but honestly it's my first time, so not sure of the items I ordered or the portion. Then he grabs my menu after I just finished telling him that I might order more stuff. The answer is we grab menus after taking the order, which doesn't make any sense. Then I asked him if I can order stuff to go to my partner at home, and the answer was that the sandwich is the only thing they do to go. A whole bunch of stupid rules that don't make no sense.  Do these guys understand that being accommodating is a skill that's needed to stay in this industry. Just weird pretentious spot. Too bad even though the  food wasn't traditional Portuguese, it was good and full of flavor that's why I gave them 3 stars. I still added tip on top of the 20% they added, coz I don't believe in stiffing severs, it's their bread n butter. But in all honesty the service is subpar. I wish them the best and hopefully they follow a more customer driven approach so they can survive in this tough market.","1215 Cypress Ave Los Angeles, CA 90065",4.3,35,Portuguese,

We didn't mind though because we ordered a glass of wine while waiting on their benches outside. Super small and cute restaurant with good vibes as it was in a quiet neighborhood. There really is nothing else around though so it was a bit of a drive and parking was difficult to find although it's surrounded by neighborhoods.Our favorite was the shrimp although it was a bit fishy-- the oil was great with the bread. The tuna Crudo was very refreshing although the lemon flavor overpowered the fish. The sardine toasts were great but I wish it was all warm or all cold. The endive salad was unique but not my favorite. The fish was also unique but a bit too herbal for my liking.Our server was great! All the male servers were friendly but the female servers were less friendly.

Service was great for takeout.When having Thai food, I always judge the restaurant by their most basic dishes. We ordered chicken pad Thai and beef pad see ew. It was so incredibly delicious. Their pad Thai is not overly sweet like some places, and the noodles were cooked perfectly!! The vegetables in the pad see ew were perfect, and still crunchy. The food also came with chili sauce, red pepper seasoning, and vinegar with chilis. The vinegar made the pad see ew out of this world.

We were able to be seated within 5 minutes. Turnaround was quick, and initial impression gave that authentic vibe we were looking for.

Would be great paired with some rice next time!The Pad Thai had the perfect balance of sweetness, countered by the limes. Next time I would try the beef, but the shrimp was a nice upgrade.Pad Kee Mao had a good sauce mix, with the spicy kick adding in a little to the dish. Not to mention, the eggs in the pad kee mao + pad thai were standouts :) (if i could get double portions of eggs i would 100% go for it)Overall, if you are looking for authentic thai food with no funny business, this is the place to go to.

The place was clean and the staff took the time to check up on your needs and the steel grill was constantly replaced to ensure clean cooking. The service was fast and since it was not busy at that time for lunch, they extended the time limit to two hours instead of the usual 90 minutes.

The quality of the meat themselves are pretty okay. The prime sirloin steak is definitely our go to order most of the time as it seems to be the highest quality one that they have.

I got the ""pleasant outdoor"" part right, but the breakfast part was beyond the pale disappointing, almost annoying.  First, I'm absolutely sure none of the food was fresh. The ""breakfast potatoes"" looked like round black rocks & were almost as hard, & had some other soft, mushy types of vegetables mixed in. The sausage was dry & hard & the bacon, which I'd asked for very crisp, was like a soft, greasy sponge (even my dog wouldn't eat it) & the eggs, which I'd asked for medium well, we so undone, they ran ALL over the plate. None of it was hot in the meaningful sense of the word. I enjoy any fast-food restaurant breakfast much more.  At least the food is always fresh & hot & the price is within the range of common sense. In addition to the seriously overpriced food they serve, they add an additional 5% ""surcharge"" which they say is to mitigate inflation & other operating costs"" but make it clear that an ""employee gratuity"" is additional.  Restaurants keep getting away with this because a naive & gullible public gladly validates the old adage that ""A fool & his money are soon parted.""  I find this trend annoying & offensive &, I fear, it's only going to get worse as more & more people simply pay up without objection.  As for Bottega Louie. their other food & their pastries look good from the window, but my dog & I will never find out. BTW, I'm now considering adding a ""surcharge"" to all of my tenants' monthly rents to cover increasing operating costs.  Sounds fair to me.","8936 Santa Monica Blvd Los Angeles, CA 90069",4.1,740,"Bakeries, Desserts, Italian",$$$

Having previously fallen in love with their French onion soup at the downtown location, I was eager to savor it on a rainy day in Hollywood. However, upon arrival during brunch hours, I learned that they don't serve this delightful soup during brunch. But the hostess, who was incredibly accommodating, told me to return in 30 minutes so I could indulge in what I came for.During that brief interlude, my partner and I explored the charming area, making the most of our time. When we returned, the same hostess greeted us with a warm smile and genuine interest in how we spent our time - a delightful touch that made us feel truly valued.Our waiter, Jessica, deserves special mention for her exceptional service. She guided us seamlessly through our dining experience and was a wealth of information when we had questions about their bakery offerings. I kicked off my meal with the long-awaited French onion soup, and it was nothing short of amazing.

Onion rings, lamb sliders and rickshaw pasta. Not even a little heat. Why?! The pasta and pizza faves that people post about here were the only items on neighboring tables. Kind of one note. The soft serve saved them, but then we were told to hurry up and leave. There were people waiting for our table. Hookay, next time don't expect us to pay the full 19% service fee + ask if we'd like to contribute 3-5% more.

The thing to get here is the rigatoni. The Pijja was okay. My son has dairy and egg allergies so he didn't have much options (also because he can't handle spicy food yet). They agreed to make him a cheeseless pijja with peperoni. The sauce was not traditional tomato sauce so picky son was not super into it. We took it home and added vegan cheese to it and he ate a little bit more. The vibes are great and the rigatoni is also great. The cheesy rickshaw pasta we got was not the best.

Considering the price ($37) I was expecting something amazing. Noodles were good but clumpy and not as fresh tasting as I expected. The broth flavor was pretty good but it was very oily - I asked for it spicy and they added some spice that was pretty good.

180,2023-08-02,2023-09-17,Kazan,"What I find beautiful about Japanese culture, is understanding, how gastronomy has played a major role in their rich history. Let's begin by Saying earning a Michelin star is no ordinary occurrence. Having three Michelin stars makes you absolutely unique and extraordinary.You have earned the title and respect, because for you, it's about passion.You don't believe in cutting corners when it comes to the highest quality ingredients. You believe that if one must deliver the best experience and food quality it must be done right or you don't do it at all.My family and I had a wonderful experience at the museum corridor near Wilshire and La Brea. We used Yelp to search ramen restaurants in that area and Kazan populated first.Noodles really didn't become a stable food in Japan until the 1800s. If you truly want to taste an authentic Japanese ramen house you found the place, no need to fly to Tokyo anymore.Oh boy, what a wonderful experience. As you can see by the photographs the restaurant is a bit small but Gosh when it comes to the taste of the fresh soba thin noodles ,the distinctive flavors of the light broth, and to your tongue's desire you feel the tender texture of the chashu pork,. Now, you realized you are in Ramen's heaven.We ordered two Signature #1 dish, and one Lei ramen. Absolutely, delicious. Something I personally found interesting the design of the serving bowls. As you are being served you don't realized that the size portion of this soup is rather large, but it looks small.Trust me it's feels you-up because the bowl has a unique design that keeps a lot of the noodles at the bottom of the bowl.The restaurant is absolutely clean, the staff were friendly and professional.Last, this is a secret, if you want the best time to peacefully enjoy your meal and savor every ingredient come around 4pm. We parked at an adjacent parking structure next to the restaurant just pay the fee and relax.

So we asked if we could have it removed.They said they never have people return food....never ever??...they suggested to take 30% off the dish. We requested to speak to a manager...then We had to suggest requesting a new meal Comp'd. Which we did get but still ended up paying full price for the ramen- not to mention the food she ordered was cheaper.We then asked to speak to the owner. We were told he was not there, when we asked when he would be there they said they did not know.

If you are a meat eater, 10/10 recommend and would give it 5 stars.If they didn't handle the situation properly, and if it weren't so good (pre sickness), I would've rated it 1.

We had a few appetizer type dishes (calamari, and french fries) that were really quite nice, although not necessarily indicative of what their major dishes had to offer. That being said, I have no worry about the major dishes being, quite frankly, major.Another really enjoyable evening jere at Employees Only, where the atmosphere was great the music was gentle yet provided sounds that filled the room with energy and their bartenders were quite delightful!","7953 Santa Monica Blvd West Hollywood, CA 90046",4.1,450,"Cocktail Bars, American (New), Lounges",$$$

It's pretty during the day but more charming at night. For starters, we got the calamari fritti ($24), burrata pugliese ($26), and cesare ($18) to share. The calamari was good, but not crispy. While the burrata was pretty small.For pasta, my friends got the spaghetti latini ($36), tortelli di burrata ($38), and pappardelle al cinghile ($42). My friend also got the salmon ($44) and I got the pollo arrosto ($42). The portions were good and filling. My pollo was juicy with a yummy sauce. They don't offer anything complimentary for birthdays, but they do nicely decorate any dessert you order. We got the cuore di cioccolata ($18), which was a heart shaped chocolate cake.There were lots of servers, always ready to help. The service was great!

183,2023-05-24,2023-09-17,Il Cielo,"This is definitely one of the most beautiful and romantic restaurants in LA. This time we were sitting in the front patio since there was a private party in the back patio. Honestly, both patios are beautiful. We started with couple of drinks and Cesare salad and mixed green salad. I thought the salads were ordinary, nothing to brag about. Maybe I should try a different salad next time. for main course, two of us ordered the Burrata e Aragosta, it was very delicious but only two small piece of lobster in it and the rest was rice and creamy sauce. As I said very tasty but for that price, we both thought they should have put more lobster in it. For those of you who had read my last review on this restaurant, last time I was there, I had ordered the same thing but asked our server to substitute the rice with any kind of pasta if possible and he said yes but he didn't mention anything about the extra charge for substitution and brought me pasta with lobster in a creamy sauce and the price was almost twice as much which I noticed only when he bought us the check, from $39 jumped to $64 which I thought for a substitute, if the price is jumping that much, you MUST let the customer know in advance. Of course, $39 was the old price for this item and now I think it is $54 which is too much for what you get. My friends ordered Salmon and Branzino. She was happy with salmon, the other one with Branzino said it was just ok. for dessert, I ordered Affagato which was basically scoop of vanilla ice cream with espresso over it and a piece of biscotto. It was good if you like ice cream.  The owner also sent us Dolcetto de limone because of the last time messed up which was a nice gesture from him but unfortunately none of us liked it but if you like the lemon taste, you probably like it but non of us did. When we got the check, first we didn't notice that 22% tip was already added to our total and we  were ready to leave tips on top of that but one of our friends who checked the check noticed it was added. I could see adding the tips automatically for party of 6 and larger but I think even if you are going to add tips automatically, should be 18 to 20 % not more than that and leave it to customers if they want to tip more. Now, do I go back to this place, probably yes because of the beautiful ambiance and honestly my food was tasty but over priced for what I got.

183,2018-11-01,2023-09-17,Il Cielo,"Il Cielo is definitely one of the most beautiful and romantic restaurants I have been in LA. I had not been there for a long time but I remember it used to be one of my favorite restaurants because of the good food and also the violin player they had going to each table and play a beautiful music. So, I called the place to make the reservation and asked them if they still had the violin player, they said not any more. I decided to still make the reservation since I really liked their beautiful patio. When we arrived we were seated right away. It was a little bit cold to sit out and they offered the back patio and gave us the option to take either one. The other couple that we were meeting suggested the back patio which was as gorgeous as the front one if not more. The service was good and we got our drinks right away. My friend ordered Bucatini all' Amatriciana $26, our husbands both ordered Pappardelle al Cinghiale $28 and I ordered Burrata e Aragosta $39 which is Carnaroli Rice, Lobster, Burrata Cream.I thought well, I like the lobster and creamy sauce but not the rice so I asked our waiter if I could substitute any kind of pasta for the rice. He said yes, I could get it with Pappardelle, lobster and truffle sauce. I said ok any kind of pasta is fine as long as I am still getting the lobster with white creamy sauce. We got our foods and they were all good. Mine was in a very rich creamy sauce which was little bit too heavy on my stomach but I should admit that it was one of the most delicious dish I have ever had. When we got the bill, we noticed that one of the items were $64 which was more than any thing we saw on the menu and none of us ordered something for $64. We thought that must be a mistake and when we asked our waiter he said that was for my food. That was the only reason that I gave it 4 stars. I didn't think for substituting rice with pasta the price of my food jumps from $39 to $64 and I think we should have been told about such a big price change by our waiter. Later on I called the restaurant and told the manager that in other restaurants when you substitute something they will let you know right away even if the difference is couple of dollars so don't you think when the price changes to twice as much you should definitely let the customer know? He explained that this was a different dish than the other one because had more lobster with truffle sauce ( I just asked for a substitute not a different dish) but he also agreed that we had to be told about the big price change. He was very nice and understanding and said next time you are here you will have your drinks and couple of desserts on the house. I thought that was fair and good customer service and I am definitely going back since I love the ambiance but I will be very careful with my substitutes. Lol....

I was getting the #19, and I was going to enjoy it before my long drive back home lol.I drove down and parked in the lot.  They give you a ticket to get validated, its one hour free parking.  I walked down the block, opened the door, walked inside and told them I wanted to place a ""to go"" order.  They write down your order on a yellow piece of paper, you pay at the register ($26.00 or so), and then I took a seat.  A few minutes later, my sandwich was ready.  I took it to go, back to my car and bust it open on the trunk of my car.  How was it?#19- Sweet baby Jesus!  This sandwich lives up to the hype!  Its hot pastrami, cole slaw, swiss cheese and Russian dressing piled on their double crusted rye bread.  Man, this sandwich was bomb!  First bite in, I knew I was in the presence of greatness.  This sandwich is huge, too!  You could probably split one with a buddy, but you are also missing out on pure deliciousness if you don't eat the whole thing yourself.  The bread was warm, chewy and crunchy, the pastrami was hot and fatty and tender, the cole slaw and Russian dressing were cool and creamy, and the Swiss cheese added a little tang.  Pretty much a perfect sandwich.  I ""oooohhhh and aaaahhed"" after every bite and made my way through the whole thing. Loved every single bite.  The only thing I might do different next time is get ""light dressing"".  It was very wet in certain parts and on certain bites.  Didn't detract from the sandwich, might just be a little less messy with lighter dressing.It was a perfect sandwich to end my long weekend in LA.  I'm already thinking about the next time I will be in LA, so I can get another one.

It was soft in the middle and crunchy and delicious on the crust.  The pastrami was the king of the show!  It was hand sliced, thick, tasty, fatty, flat out delicious!   I was super stuffed from eating pizza just an hour before, but I finished this sandwich no problem!   Yes...it was that good!  For a sandwich and 2 drinks it was about $18 bucks.  Well worth it!

It's the kind of dish that will have you closing your eyes and letting out a deep sigh of pleasure.Now, I'm not one to shy away from traditional Japanese street food, but Yakitana takes it to a whole new level with their creative options, like the lamb skewers.

The wagyu beef was tough and chewy. I've had proper wagyu and this was far from that. The pork belly skewers tasted like overcooked pork from somewhere other than the belly.  There was none of the tasty fat I would expect from a proper pork belly. The bacon wrapped mushroom was chewy, tasteless and boring.The spicy noodles and spicy rice were the only good things.

186,2023-08-05,2023-09-17,Atrium,"Highly recommend as a cute place for date night or get together with friends! Easy parking nearby if you don't mind the paid lots, which we grabbed a lot off Melbourne Ave behind the 13th Church of Christ.On a hot summer day, the outside seating was still nice with a breeze. The umbrella gives you more than enough shade too.Service was fab. Real nice and checked in at appropriate times. Food came out on time too.Food we ordered:+ Oysters: Good quality, although my boyfriend felt it was a tad salty but I thought it was perfect when balanced with the sauce and lemon.+ Arancini: The truffle didn't stand out as much as I hoped, but still a really good snack with a lovely soft inside.+ Maitake: Rich and creamy in a good way. Nice mix of buffalo sauce with a side of ranch. Carrots were nicely done, with still a small bit of crunch to it.+ Gnocchi: On the richer end with the sour cream. If you want a really soft pasta, go for this one.+ Summer Arrabiata: I really liked most of this dish. Perfect pairing of squash and baby corns for texture and al dente cavatelli. Unfortunately for myself, I'm terrible with spicy food and I didn't realize this would have a kick to it. I wish the spice didn't overpower the dish as much, but some would probably like it.+ Panna cotta: We had a panna cotta with mango slices on top. I really liked this as a lighter dessert. For those of you very familiar with dim sum, this actually reminds me of Chinese mango pudding... #iykyk.On a last fun note, the bathrooms were nice in that there were two individual rooms, but my one complaint is the lighting situation. I get having a vibe and there was a dim light over the sink, but the toilet side of the room was awfully dark without any lighting. I could barely see where the toilet was and couldn't figure out the light switches as they were taped up as if I wasn't supposed to touch it. Ended up using my phone flashlight to go. Either I'm dumb and couldn't figure out the lights or they are trying to set up a very different mood that I couldn't appreciate for a simple bathroom situation. But it'll get the job done.","1816 - A N Vermont Ave Los Angeles, CA 90027",3.9,506,"American (New), Cocktail Bars",$$$

Lacks authenticity, at least in the atmosphere.Food was quite good, although some dishes were definitely better. Carrot salad - absolutely incredible! Tagines were great too, much better with couscous on the side than meat and coucous together. Chicken pastilla was great too! I wouldn't recommend any of the vegetarian variations - vegetable pastilla or vegetable tagine.Service was very good!Parking - none. There is no parking lot and no valet.

We came here after a Kings game at the Staples Center cause we were craving some late night Korean bites.Although we didn't order an alcohol here, I could definitely see this place as a great hangout spot to pregame before going out or just in general a great space to get a bit lit! There are different rooms in this place, but they were only seating everyone in the room with the movie-theme.We ordered two plates: the chicken gizzard and the spicy intestines. Both were great however I was hoping that there would be slightly more gizzard and intestines in each dish compared to ratio of the onions, garlic, etc.I was also a bit bummed that they did not have chili paste at all. They did have sriracha and gochujang so that sufficed.Our server was nice, but at some point he started eating with his other colleague and so flagging him down for the check in the end was a bit harder.Overall, a relatively decent option in the east end of Ktown! Parking was ok for us because it was a Monday night and pretty late, but the lot was still like 90% full, so I can't imagine how the situation would be on a weekend night.","2500 W 8th St Ste 180 Los Angeles, CA 90057",4.6,138,"Gastropubs, Korean, Soup",$$

So if you order spicy just know it is spicy. If you can't handle it please order non spicy. This is for real and that's my own preference.If like me you have been influenced by instagram Korean gentlemen and gentle ladies eating, then yea you want to order from this restaurant.

They take your preferences and dietary needs into consideration when preparing your food.The Pad Thai here is the best I've ever had. The sauce was a perfect blend of sweet, savory, and acidic. The flavors of this Pad Thai were much more intense and powerful compared to other Thai restaurants I've tried. They also give a healthy serving that's worth what you're paying for.The restaurant is located within a shared parking lot so parking might be tricky, but not impossible.

The interior design is very spacious and elegant, with high ceilings. I love how the tables are very spaced out and you can have privacy in your own conversation while still getting to see people around you. The bar is stunning!Let's get into the food... wow. It's the best meal I've had in a while. If you love food, and love FLAVOR and spices you will love! Our server, who was beautiful and amazing - Saira - made the experience even better. Every single thing I ate was delicious. The chef even came out and said hi to us. The drink I ordered, Slumdog Millionare, was similar to a tequila sunrise but much better! The presentation of everything was gorgeous. Some of my favorite dishes of the night were the Chicken Malai Tikka, Lamb Keema, Tuna Bhel - the jalapeño cheddar naan is essential for sauce dipping - and my favorite dessert was the pistachio ice cream, made unique by the infusion of saffron.I want to come back and try more!

192,2023-09-12,2023-09-17,Baar Baar,"This is a good place for special occasions, it's a very beautiful space, but not necessarily a great Indian food restaurant. It's aiming for an Indian fine dining experience: the presentation, service, ambiance, and prices match that. However, if you just want some amazing Indian food or a new spot to go when you're craving some amazing Indian food, this probably isn't it. The place has good service, but it's the annoying good type (always pestering you, but on top of it) vs the predictive great service (not sure if people will get what I mean or relate). We tried several of the dishes and drinks here, see the breakdown:4/5 - Baar Baar Butter Chicken: a solid butter chicken dish with good flavors and great presentation, but very small portions with no sides of rice or anything. ($32)4/5 - Paneer Pinwheel: a delicious fine dining take on a classic North Indian dish and a nice presentation, but same small portions as the other main dish. ($32)5/5 - Mango Ghewar: an amazing mango forward dessert with delicious fresh mango cubes on the inside, looks gorgeous and tastes even better, definitely the best thing on the menu! ($18)3.5/5 - Ragi Brownie: a really beautiful dessert that is very chocolate forward, but not super sweet. However, it's disappointing in comparison to a phenomenal dessert like the Mango Ghewar. ($15)4/5 - Dahi Puri: a solid light, but refreshing appetizer. Cool presentation, perfect for two people and one of their better apps. ($14)3/5 - Saffron Rice: pretty standard rice side that is enough to share amongst 2 to 3 people. ($6)2/5 - Cheese & Jalapeno Naan: pretty mediocre, even the presentation wasn't that nice, and worth it for what you get. The regular naan seems to be a better option if you're ordering naan (seems like it's a larger size, 1/2 the price, and already cut into 4 pieces as well). ($12)Drinks:4.5/5 - DDLJ: a great modern twist on a tequila sunrise inspiration. A good mix of tangy and lightly sour flavors. ($17)3.5/5 - Rockstar: not listed on their drink menu, it's a seasonal specialty drink that features rum and is a twist on a tropical favorite. ($19)4/5 - Various decent quality wines (~$25 per glass)Food & Drinks: 4/5Service: 4/5Ambiance: 5/5Value: 3/5Overall: 4/5","705 W 9th St Los Angeles, CA 90015",4.4,115,Indian,
192,2023-09-11,2023-09-17,Baar Baar,"Last night, we decided to try this restaurant for dinner on a semi-whim, having made a reservation the day before. Our reservation was for an early slot, so we were seated pretty promptly. The decor is really interesting - definitely different from other restaurants in the area. What really impressed me was the timing of the service - everything, from the food to the drinks, arrived swiftly but not uncomfortably fast.The dining experience here is family-style, with a recommendation to order a variety of shared plates and entrees, which are served as they are prepared. For our shared plates, we chose the dahi puri, cauliflower 65, Kashmiri duck (birria) taco, and the chicken malai tikka. Among these, the dahi puri and the duck taco stood out as my favorite bites of the entire meal. They were unique, refreshing, and incredibly flavorful. However, the one disappointment of the evening was the chicken malai tikka, which seemed a bit lackluster and reminded me strangely of a bland chicken alfredo.Moving on to the entrees, we opted for the butter chicken, short ribs, and lamb shank roast, along with garlic naan and saffron rice. Each dish was sensational in its own right, but the lamb shank roast stole the show with its tender, melt-in-your-mouth texture.As a side note, if you're in the mood for a unique and tropical-flavored cocktail, do yourself a favor and order the Sholay. It'll transport you to a distant paradise and complement your meal perfectly.In summary, our impromptu visit turned out to be the perfect shared meal. With prompt service, attentive and helpful staff, a diverse array of flavorful dishes, and a standout cocktail, this restaurant is definitely worth considering for a memorable dining experience. I would just plan to skip the chicken malai tikka and savor the other delectable options they have to offer.","705 W 9th St Los Angeles, CA 90015",4.4,115,Indian,

We had to make some adjustments with our reservation and they were very accommodating and nice about the last minute changes. The staff were all very friendly and and seated us immediately when we got there. The drinks were all named after popular Hindi movies and were very good. The food came out very quickly and was great! We had the dahi puri, lamb kheema, lamb chops, and avocado bhel for starters. The lamb kheema with the pav was to die for, definitely the best dish of the night. The puri was also very flavorful. For dinner we had the paneer and the butter chicken, both of which were decent. I have been very unimpressed with Indian food in the Los Angeles area, but this restaurant was definitely the best one in LA.

192,2023-09-02,2023-09-17,Baar Baar,"I came to Baar Baar with very high expectations but left entirely disappointed with the food. Perhaps it was just an off day, or this just is how their food is, but I found myself very underwhelmed by the quality of the food.Everything felt like it had a distinct lack of flavor. The spices were barely there on some items and it felt like for an Indian restaurant, barely anything tasted like Indian. We ordered a large variety of dishes and maybe only two stood out as decent.Then to cap it all off, we ordered the Masala Chai at the evening and it came out as basically brown water. It was heavily diluted and has no flavor. Our waiter was kind enough to see that there was something wrong with it and removed it from our bill.So sad to say, I don't think I'll be coming back. For the price point, this was not at all with it. Very bland food which was overpriced. Hate to say it after coming in with such high expectations.","705 W 9th St Los Angeles, CA 90015",4.4,115,Indian,

193,2023-08-21,2023-09-17,A Food Affair,"I was here for the first time as a celebratory dinner, bringing in my birthday! As context, I hate comparing restaurants especially when I've had authentic Parisian/French cuisine in France before, but I accidentally began comparing as soon as I saw the menu. Thankfully, the dinner did NOT disappoint.We began with some drinks and the first selection we made was ""Passionate Affair"" which was absolutely PACKED with flavor and fun bubbles. We ended up getting another because we were pleasantly surprised at how well the flavors sat on our palate. After, the appetizers made our way to the table.We decided in the Bone Marrow and Escargot. Now, honestly, this was my first time trying bone marrow and I was not a fan of the texture, however I can not comment much more on the effectiveness of the dish. There was flavor, and provided some smokiness and char-like flavor provided by the toast that accompanied the dish, but again was just not a fan of my first experience with bone marrow. Now as far as the escargot goes, I have tried them in Paris and was very anxious to taste AFA's take on the classic! Very simply, DELICIOUS. The plate is smooth on the palate, packed with a calming creamy flavor that reminded me of a flavor profile almost like a pesto, served on top of a baked potato. The serving size was also appropriate for an appetizer and did exactly what it was meant to do to warm us up for the main course. Simply could have had many more of these dishes but then... the mains came!We decided on Moms beef bourguignon and the Lamb shank tagine. Both meat selections absolutely melted in our mouths and really had their own strengths. However, we did prefer the Beef to the lamb because it had just a bit more intensity and punch that we were looking for, than the lighter, more delicate lamb with vegetables. It really just comes down to how heavy of a dish you are looking for and on another day I could see myself selecting the lamb. The pasta, made in house, was a good compliment to the beef due to its thickness and smooth contrast to a more layered protein. There was much more beef to pasta, which we had no problem with.Lastly was desert! Creme brûlée is one of those options that's simple and delicious when done right, but also has much potential to be bland, and just not up to par. It tasted exactly how you would imagine the great dessert to taste, with flavor, creaminess, and a perfectly crisped topping. No surprises, just very well executed.Overall, I have no complaints with my experience at the restaurant. Parking was accessible (a lot just behind the restaurant), there was welcoming service from the moment we walked in to the second we stepped out of the door, the environment was hip, romantic, and lended itself to conversation and liveliness, and just overall photogenic. I very much recommend this restaurant, and applaud its originality and fresh taste reminiscent of a Parisian experience right in LA's backyard!","1513 S Robertson Blvd Los Angeles, CA 90035",4.5,1564,French,$$$

So we waited...and waited...and waited, then it was about 15 mins after our reservation time. This whole time we were standing next to a table of 4 that was EMPTY from the time we got into the restaurant. We all joked with each other that they will seat us there.. and guess what, they did.After getting seated, we were handed a menu and I was pretty underwhelmed. It was more Vietnamese fusion/inspired rather than authentic Vietnamese food. (Not a huge deal but just wanted to point that out)Overall, the vibes of the restaurant was good.. the drinks were doable, they have certain tastes to them (just make sure you know what each ingredient in the drinks taste like before ordering).I don't think I would come back to this restaurant, it's pretty small and the food was not memorable. But it's worth trying, just to try.","755 N La Cienega Blvd West Hollywood, CA 90069",3.8,98,Vietnamese,
195,2023-09-14,2023-09-17,Di Di,"Parking: either find street parking with the meter or do valet for $15Food: as much of a fan I am of Tue Nguyen, the food did not live up to the hype and expectation I had. I had recently just traveled to vietnam as well so I was excited for the nha Trang beach club cocktail but wasn't too excited when sipping on it. I do recommend getting the prawn and beef carpaccio, if you go. They were delicious but just felt overpriced in my opinion. The crab fried rice had more shell than crab meat. Overall, I really really wanted to like this place but sadly my experience is preventing me from wanting to go back. I still highly recommend everyone to try this place and experience it themselves. This is just mine.Tip: the host won't mention it, but if you don't have a reservation and they're fully book, ask to sit at the bar as it is first come first serve. But be careful, my friend and I sat there, but it felt like a splash zone with the bartenders mixing the drink. I had to wipe my face several time from the splashes I was getting from it.","755 N La Cienega Blvd West Hollywood, CA 90069",3.8,98,Vietnamese,
195,2023-09-14,2023-09-17,Di Di,"10/10 for the ambiance and the decor of the place.8/10 for the service.  Had to ask the server multiple times for fresh chilis, however was still never brought to us, so had to ask who seems to be the boss to help us get the chili.1/10 for the seat time. Made a reservation for 9:15pm however was not seated till 9:45pm. What is the point of reservations when your still required to wait way pass your reservation time.1/10 for the food. Definitely not worth it for the price and portion of the food. For what your paying, definitely could get more for your buck.1) Honey Glazed Tiger Prawns ($24)- Aside from how big the Tiger prawns are, literally deep fried in batter and that was it. The only glazed was on the plate for presentation and nothing on the prawns. No flavoring what so ever. Had to cut the Tiger prawns to dip into the glazed that was on the plate.2)Chicken Wings ($23)- Fish sauce chicken wings were soooo salty, couldn't even eat it alone. Nothing special but that it had fish sauce flavoring.3)Lobster Curry ($44)- Loved that we got chunks of fried lobster meat in the curry, however no curry flavor and just coconut flavoring.4) Whole Fried Snapper ($64)- Definitely could've gotten a lot more for the price. But one of the better dishes they serve. Fish was well fried. However, the sweet and sour sauce seems to have been the one straight out the bottle.5)Hot Sesame. Noodle ($24)-Noodles was super bland and had no flavoring even with the chili and garlic crunch. Garlic crunch was over fried and bitter. Noodles was under cooked and this dish was super disappointing.(No picture)6)Crab Fried Rice ($25)- Literally this dish was not worth it. Portion was super small, and you could taste it literally was just fried rice. No crab flavoring or even crab meat in the fried rice. Super salty.Lastly, got charge 4% for entertainment fee. When we asked what the charge was we were told ""we have a DJ in house Friday night and Saturday night.""  Come on DIDI. Having a DJ is not the customers request. Shouldn't charge customers for something your establishment decides to have.Overall, it was an experience definitely not worth the money.Everything with the entertainment fee included $232.32. Definitely for this amount I could've spent it elsewhere.","755 N La Cienega Blvd West Hollywood, CA 90069",3.8,98,Vietnamese,
195,2023-09-11,2023-09-17,Di Di,"I recently heard about DiDi through TikTok and was super excited to support and dine at this restaurant. Here's my 4/5 Yelp review:Food: 4/5I tried the Tamarind Ginger Mocktail, Shrimp Prawns, Snapper, and Hot Noodles. The food was delicious, and the flavors were on point. My only minor gripe is that the noodles could have been a bit hotter. Everything else on the plate was served at the perfect temperature, and the taste was fantastic.Ambiance: 5/5DiDi's ambiance deserves a solid 5/5. The atmosphere was inviting, and it provided a great backdrop for a memorable dining experience. It's clear they pay attention to detail in creating a welcoming space.Price: $$$/$$$$While the pricing is on the higher side, it's justified by the quality of the food, the fantastic ambiance, and the music. DiDi offers an all-around great dining experience that's worth the occasional splurge.Customer Service (Dawn): 5/5Dawn, our server, was exceptional. She was charismatic, knowledgeable about the menu, funny, and helped curate our order to perfection. Her presence added to the overall enjoyment of our evening.Parking: $$$Parking was a bit of a shocker. $15 inside their structure is reasonable, but $40 on the street in front is quite steep. It's something to consider when planning your visit.In summary, DiDi is a TikTok find that's definitely worth trying. With mouthwatering food, an inviting atmosphere, and exceptional customer service from Dawn, it's a dining experience that leaves a positive impression. While the location and parking could be better, I'd still give it a solid 4/5 and would happily return for another visit.","755 N La Cienega Blvd West Hollywood, CA 90069",3.8,98,Vietnamese,

For starters, I had some doubts about the shrimp toast, but I'm delighted we ordered it; it turned out to be my absolute favorite from the menu. The honey-glazed tiger prawns and the Mama Do buns tied for a close second. The crispy egg rolls were also a delightful treat. While the crab fried rice was decent, I might opt for the regular fried rice next time. The snapper dish was not only tasty but impressively sizable.

The night was 818 night which was poppin. Decent amount of influencers were there. Ambiance and vibe is cute and trendy. Music on point. Get the wagu. Won't be disappointed. Fried rice was good.

We got there for our reservation a bit late, so we hung out at the bar until our table was ready. The decor and ambiance of the restaurant was beautiful. It was elevated Vietnamese design. Every corner was a photo spot. We got the tropic thunder, Nha trang beach club and Nguyễn in Rome. Surprisingly the Nguyễn in Rome was our favorite drink. It looked to be the strongest but was actually the sweetest. Tropic thunder and nha trang beach club were a little bit too sour in our opinion and we were expecting a more milky or refreshing taste. We ordered the tiger prawns, bo luc lac, banh xeo, lobster curry, and Vietnamese coffee creme brûlée. All the food was delicious and full of flavor. The tiger prawns were good and in a sweet sauce. The bo luc lac was really delicious. The meat was very nicely marinaded and the beef was cooked perfectly. It was served on a bed of greens that was also very good and light. The banh xeo was very crispy almost like a taco. The lobster curry was the star of the show and served with delicious flavored rice. The creme brûlée was good but it would've been even better cold. Overall, would definitely visit the restaurant again to try the snapper or sea bass since they were out of the snapper. A perfect date or girls night place.

We ordered, a pork bun, ramen, spicy tuna bowls, pork curry and spam. It sounds like we ordered a lot, but the item came out portioned very small.The taste was good, just very little serving size. Ramen tasted ok, and curry tasted like it was either microwaved or sitting a little as the sauce was not consistent and sort of clumpy.Food came out quickly.Overall, if your hungry and looking to eat up, unless you pay over 50 bucks for two persons, it's not happening. If you're just looking to have a quick bite and not super hungry, this place is it.The place looks a little dated, but reminiscent of place in Okinawa and Japan.

The Hainan chicken is similar to the Singapore version but it's done Thai style. Meaning the broth, rice and side sauces are a bit different. The sauce they use is like crack and they keep it on the table so you can pour to your hearts content!  They also have ginger and chili on the table that you can use to customize your sauce.

The broth was rich and creamy and the beef was enjoyable.  Compared to the tsukemen though, it was very very mild.My favorite item was the collard greens which came with the tsukemen.  It was spicy and tasty and probably the best part of the meal.  My friend recommended the brussel sprouts which I'll try if I come back.","209 N Western Ave Unit B Los Angeles, CA 90004",4.7,314,"Ramen, Izakaya, Tapas/Small Plates",$$

While the ramen is AMAZING and definitely worth coming in for, it's the bento box which immediately blew me away.I ordered for takeout and was not expecting presentation as gorgeous as what I received. Salad, karaage, sando, fruit, and pickles, all beautifully arranged inside of their box, not a shred of presentation lost in the trip back home.However, as pretty as food may be, it counts for nought if the flavor isn't there.Salad is exactly as you'd expect from a Japanese joint, what tasted like a sesame dressing on top. Light, refreshing, enjoyable start to my meal.Karaage came with a dipping cup of mayo (?), but I did not need it as the chicken on its own is beautifully marinated and flavorful. Fruit cup delivered exactly what you'd expect, fresh fruit that was perfectly arranged and served at peak flavor. Main event Katsu sando at the forefront, perfectly flavorful chicken sandwiched in between bread with cabbage and mayo; perhaps I'd go a bit easier on the mayo but the flavor is all there so I'm not complaining!Having not been a fan of pickles my whole life, I proceeded with caution as I said ""might as well try them"". What followed was the serving of pickles that single handedly made me a fan of pickled food as a whole! Spicy, flavorful, and not too intense in their flavor!I'd say I'd return, but given that I've now been a semi-regular, it's not matter of if, but when!","209 N Western Ave Unit B Los Angeles, CA 90004",4.7,314,"Ramen, Izakaya, Tapas/Small Plates",$$

199,2023-05-30,2023-09-17,Reunion Hollywood,"As a previous member of Neuehouse I was delighted to receive an invite to try out the new Reunion Hollywood. I was skeptical as there was very little information on the restaurant/ menu/ food, but having spent time at Neuehouse and even tried their cafe's I knew they would not disappoint. And they certainly did not. Everything at this place was done tastefully and elegantly. The entry way is beautifully lit with terracotta lanterns and the terrace has a beautiful classy yet warm vibe to it. This place screams pretentious but it is surprisingly not - wait staff are incredibly friendly and attentive. Now the food. Everything on the menu sounded appetizing and since there was only two of us, we couldn't order too many different things. We were torn between ordering a few items to get a feel of the flavors or ordering the whole fish and just enjoying it. We went for the whole fish and we were glad we didn't order anything along with it. The rockfish arrived in a tasteful stainless steel platter, and was filleted in the kitchen and sliced in the platter without losing its ""whole fish"" look. It sat on a bed of a medley of fresh salad veggies that maintained their crisp consistency despite sitting under a hot fish. Aka. They were not soggy. The seasoning of the fish was perfect, and the herbs mixed in with the spring veggies really lifted the flavors and made everything taste so light, smooth and fresh, while maintaining some richness thanks to the boldness of the olive oil in the sauce/dressing. I would highly recommend trying this place out. I'll definitely be back to taste more of this gorgeous menu!","1538 N El Centro Ave Fl 2 Los Angeles, CA 90028",5.0,3,"Bars, Italian",

We had only eaten once the day before and ended up having to raid our hotel's ""mini store"" at about 2am after the concert lol.Blu Jam Café did not disappoint at all! The food was extremely good, I am big breakfast guy - as it is my favorite meal. Both my wife and I created our own scrambles (she got egg whites), we both were very impressed by the portions that they give you as you really do get your money's worth. They have about 5 freshly squeezed juices to choose from and she ended up choosing Orange Juice which was so fresh! My dirty Chai was very good as they topped it off with cinnamon that was a great compliment to my scramble.

202,2023-09-14,2023-09-17,Taberu,"Taberu is a sleek interpolation of an izakaya, the traditional Japanese pub, in the Arts District, a few blocks east of Little Tokyo. Although the address is on Third Street (the same address as Yunomi Handroll), the entrance is actually on Traction Avenue, between Wurstküche and Loqui. Along the back wall is a long banquette with two-tops, while a massive refectory table sits in the front for shared dining. Around 5:30 P.M. on a Tuesday, there was only one other party of two; leaving around 7:00 P.M., there were maybe four parties total (one of which was that same party that was there when I arrived). The meal starts with a finger bowl to soak the little napkin pellet, and after a flashback to Melissa McCarthy in ""Spy,"" you're off to the races.The menu has a large selection of Japanese and Japanese-style craft beers, but the prices are high (as is common with imported Japanese suds), so I decided to try one of their drinks based on shōchū, a neutral spirit that is generally around 25% ABV and the Japanese analog to soju. (They only have a beer-and-wine license, so no Toki highballs here.) The Ginger Lemonade High was made with gari ginger, the pickled ginger served alongside sushi (an odd choice), and the advertised mint was nowhere to be found. The big wad of gari and ice took up a lot of real estate in the glass, and, for $9, it was rather disappointing, and I switched to draft Sapporo after that.Taberu lists its kushiyaki as ""Yasai Maki,"" translating to ""vegetable rolls"" -- even when there are no vegetables involved. Servers come over with a large box of uncooked skewers for diners to peruse, like a yakitori version of a dessert cart. (Between the dim lighting and forest of identification twigs, it's close to impossible to see anything in that box.) They have some unique varieties, although the most creative aren't necessarily the best. I made the mistake of cutting the chile relleno with the knife provided, and the ground pork chili filling oozed out everywhere; it was impossible to eat with chopsticks. It was tasty but a ridiculous mess. The shiso and gari rolled with pork belly was surprisingly bland, as was the bundle of green onions wrapped in pork belly. The tsukune (chicken meatballs) were tasty, but I would have preferred the traditional sweet soy glaze over shredded Parmesan, and three smaller meatballs over the two large ones. My favorites were the more traditional skewers: yakitori, beef (""yakiniku""), and okra wrapped in pork belly, which is probably my favorite kushiyaki ever. The kushiyaki are served with a curry-like dry spice blend that is very tasty, though it can overwhelm the flavors.The gyōza are made in-house and probably the second-best examples in L.A. after the reigning champions about a mile south at Afuri. They are unique in their shape, which resemble a taquito rather than the well-known crescent shape. I did miss the traditional tare sauce. (As with the skewers, they recommended I slather the gyōza in chili oil.) The karaage was also excellent, with five plump, flavorful pieces of dark meat in a powdery, tatsuta-age breading. I ended up taking most of the gyōza and karaage home, especially because I had to save room for the hōjicha pudding. Hōjicha is green tea that is roasted in a pot over charcoal, and it has a nutty, toasty flavor. The Japanese are master pudding makers, and this version, which is just slightly sweet, creamy, and slightly tannic, is delicious. As full as I was, I could've devoured a half-dozen of those tiny little puddings. It was the star of the meal, hands down.My experience at Taberu wasn't perfect, but it was definitely positive. There are many things I did not get to sample that I want to try, and I'd like to go with others next time -- Taberu definitely seems like it would be more fun with a group. I did feel like I was forgotten a few times at the back of the room, and some empty dishes lingered on the table a bit too long, but my server was very friendly. I would recommend having some regular napkins along with the magic tablet one: I thought that was simply for cleansing one's hands at the beginning, not to keep through the entire meal, so I ended up having to duck into the restroom for paper towels at one point. Don't most places take the wet towel away after one use? But I digress. As Little Tokyo seems to have fewer and fewer good Japanese dining options, it's good to see a place like Taberu opening up nearby, and I think it holds promise as one of Downtown's most promising Japanese dining options.","806 E 3rd St Unit 140 Los Angeles, CA 90013",4.2,159,"Ramen, Izakaya",
202,2023-09-13,2023-09-17,Taberu,"Rating: (3.5/5)I recently dined at Taberu, and it left me with mixed feelings. The appetizers, notably the karaage and seafood tartar, were absolutely delicious, deserving a solid 5-star rating. However, my overall experience was tempered by some disappointments.The main dishes, unfortunately, didn't quite live up to the same standard as the appetizers. They were generally okay in taste, but nothing exceptional. Now, the real letdown was the service. It seemed like a tale of two experiences - heavenly food from the kitchen and a somewhat frustrating encounter with a few employees.In particular, during our order of the Yakisoba, we encountered an unsettling situation. To our dismay, we found a hair coiled between the noodles. We politely pointed this out to our waiter, expecting an apology and for the dish to be replaced. Instead, his response was rather disheartening. He asked us, ""So what would you like me to do? Remove the hair or do you want us to remake everything?"" This response felt dismissive, as if our concern was being brushed aside with a casual remark.While the food itself had its moments of brilliance, the overall experience suffered due to subpar service. The chefs clearly have culinary expertise, but the front-of-house staff could benefit from a more customer-centric approach.The interior of the restaurant is a visual treat. It exudes a warm, inviting ambiance that's perfect for a night out. The comfortable seating arrangements make it an ideal spot for a relaxed evening with friends or a special someone. It's a place where aesthetics meet comfort, enhancing the overall dining atmosphere.","806 E 3rd St Unit 140 Los Angeles, CA 90013",4.2,159,"Ramen, Izakaya",

We enjoyed that they have yakitori style skewers that consist of traditional meat and veggie options, with the yaki niku and mochi being our favorites. We tried both of their chicken meatball and satay chicken thigh options and were not too impressed. We also had their wagyu and uni wagyu options, both of which were solid.We haven't tried their entrees or their ramen, but the Gyu Shabu Soba Salad was excellent and we recommended that they keep it on the menu! The flavor was very rich and refreshing at the same time, with generous portions of both soba noodles and meat. Lastly, the artichoke mochi gratin was also pretty good. Personally, I wish there was a bit more artichoke inside as it tasted a lot like a creamy mochi gratin, which was still good and flavorful.Service: 7/10Upon entering, you are greeted by the host and the owner, both of which have been welcoming in our two visits. Our server the first time was decent, but our server the second time was very sweet and accommodating. She was attentive and knowledgeable of the menu, engaging in small talk and not being pushy.Ambiance: 8/10The restaurant itself is pretty dim and not very big. The decor and arrangement of the room is nice, but I'm personally not a huge fan of dim restaurant lighting. The tables and seating are overall pretty comfortable and clean which I can appreciate. No real complaints here.Overall: 7.8/10Taberu is a solid restaurant with good food and drinks.

The tan tan ramen is absolutely a winner and should be celebrated. I believe I tasted peanuts in my soba fried rice dish also. They have laska and chicken satay and other Thai influenced items as well, all with the Japanese twist. Interior is casual but classy. Yellowtail carpaccio was quite good.

We had to eat so quickly and the food wasn't even that great. I'm sure the waiter was busy with all the other patrons but we were just not attended to well enough. Had to wait for everything, salt and pepper, water refills, etc. Honestly, salt and pepper should just be at the table and maybe out down a water dispenser for the table - I don't mind refulling myself. Maybe have some extra staff on show nights - especially if you are going to add an extra 20% service charge. I don't mind it.

Because of this service was quite attentive but the overall empty ambience was a bit weird.Options are quite limited for vegetarians-- I made my own dry pot plate (Malatang), where you self-serve and choose which vegetables you want to be cooked for you in a spicy savory sauce. It was a bit oily but very flavorful and filling, satisfying my spicy craving. I also ordered tofu and vegetable roll skewers. The flavor was delicious, Smokey, spicy and sweet. It was very hard to bite, though, and a bit hard to chew. Both the vegetables and tofu skins were tough.My friend ordered chicken skewers and kimchi bokkeumbap and enjoyed those.Pretty enjoyable place-- if the restaurants around have too long of a wait, I'd be happy to come back but would not necessarily choose this again as my first choice.

I feel like it's missing something though.. oh and we tried the Jasmine passion fruit tea, so goood!! I can't wait to come back to try other dishes.

205,2023-08-31,2023-09-17,Liu's Cafe,"TL;DR Food Amazing, Ambience Great, don't sit on the white stools.Happened to see the soft opening sign while my wife and I were on our way elsewhere and I thought... ""why not?"" I'm so glad we did because... wow!We walk in and the ambience is great. Nice, clean, minimalistic/newtro aesthetic. It was also nice seeing the chefs working behind the counter rather than hidden in the back. Guy at the counter was super nice. Ordered our food, took our table number card, and found a seat immediately. It was busy but not packed. There's some nice big tables in the center of the dining area which could comfortably seat 6 maybe crush in 8, and some smaller tables on the perimeter. I sat on the side that had the long bench with white stools on the other side of the table. I don't recommend the white stools, my butt went numb after a while, try getting the other seats with the nicer chairs especially if you're a bigger person like me.Despite the discomfort of the stool, this place gets 5 stars because the food is amazing. We had an order of three Braised Pork Belly over rice, Chiayi Chicken Rice, Egg Tart, Hong Kong Milk Tea, and later a free Pineapple Bread.Chiayi Chicken Rice was nicely seasoned. As the seasoning soaked into the rice it gave it a partial congee texture which made the meal feel very cozy (I may get this on sick days from now on). The spicy pickled radish it came with gave it a nice contrast. Add the chili sauce to every spoonful of chicken rice and it was perfection.The Braised Pork Belly over rice came a little late which is why we got our free Bread but it was worth the wait (also not docking points because it is a soft opening after all and they're figuring this stuff out). Once again the seasoning was key, and the cucumber pickle perfectly cuts the greasiness of the Pork Belly. I wouldn't advise everyone at the table getting this together though. My wife and I shared half and thought it would have been a bit overwhelming to deal with if one of us had our own bowl.Egg Tart was so good. It was a more custardy egg tart. Wife says the texture reminds her of a soft serve. Perfectly flaky on the outside. A+Pineapple bun... mm...mmm... chef's kiss. So soft out on the inside and perfectly crispy on the outside. They gave us butter with the bread but honestly didn't need it.  Now I'm glad our Pork Belly dish came out late cuz I would've missed put on my new favorite Pineapple bread.","3915 1/2 W 6th St Los Angeles, CA 90020",5.0,8,Cafes,

But prices were high relative to the quality.Cocktails and wine were good but overpriced.Also, they charged an extra 5% fee, supposedly for their workers, but I checked their website afterwards, and it's clear that the fee is going to the restaurant, not directly to employees. I felt that this was incredibly deceptive. Moreover, I did not even know about the fee until we got the check. Apparently it was somewhere on the menu (which I did not see when ordering), but who reads all the fine print on a menu?

Maybe I'm the fool, but, when I get hostility from the bartender when I ask for a martini (and I watch him make it) and there's no vermouth so I inquire about the vermouth and he gives me attitude, I get defensive. I'm sorry, but, a martini has vermouth. Yes, the amount is relative but otherwise it's gin/vodka up.

So I go to the bar to order food and I'm standing there in a great mood, chatting with the nice drag queen that was working, when suddenly I feel a hard triple slap on my shoulder. I turn around and this female bartender (found out her name is Amy) gives me the nastiest attitude and yells at me that customers are not allowed to stand there. I was shocked! I looked at her and said don't you ever put your hands on me again. Then, she replied, ""You can go see the exit!"" Wow. First of all, there would have been no issue if she kindly asked me to move. The audacity that she thought she had the right to hit me is beyond my comprehension. And then to tell me to leave instead of apologizing after? So I asked for the manager. I watched her as she went over to him, pointing at me, really just acting and looking angry and out of control. The manager came over and basically told me the same thing she did, that customers can't stand there and she was letting me know. Yes, I understand that. But can we address the fact that she was rude and placed her hands on me? He told me he didn't think she really did that! My friends were standing there watching and other customers were shocked. So not only did this uncouth bartender assault me, but the manager told me I was lying about it. What a hellhole. BTW, the manager's name I'm told is Cody. Also, after reading the other negative reviews of this place, they all have the same theme. This place has the worst customer service I've ever experienced. They are not just rude, they are abusive.

He answered all of our questions promptly and humorously and continued to check in on us as the evening went on--making sure our water glasses were always full.The food was delicious and everyone left there full and happy to have leftovers for tomorrow. Half of our party ate family style and the other half got their own dishes. Both of which are easily doable so whatever experience you're looking for they can accommodate. i even forgot to ask for a dish to be not spicy and they immediately took it back to the kitchen and re-prepared it for me.After the meal I asked for the manager to express how wonderful our server, Matt, had done.

211,2023-08-11,2023-09-17,Hollywood Thai,"We came in here tonight after doing a photoshoot nearby - we were a party of two young women. The restaurant had an overwhelmingly unpleasant 'fishy' smell as soon as we walked in, like spoiled seafood, and the vast majority of the restaurant was empty. We were seated immediately in a booth and brought water but it took awhile to get menus and drinks. The server was friendly but he NEVER came back--- we were left on our own for SO LONG without anyone coming by to see how we were doing. He told us to use the QR code for accurate pricing since the menus they gave us were not up to date (then why give them to us at all?). I ordered fried tofu and asked for a side of peanut sauce instead of sweet chili, and my friend ordered pad see ew and some mango sticky rice for dessert. Our food took maybe 20 minutes to come out. The food was hot and fresh, the tofu perfectly crisp on the outside, but it was VERY mushy and soggy on the inside, like too much water was left in it maybe? And extremely bland, no flavor whatsoever. Even when I dipped it in the peanut sauce that just tasted like peanut butter, no seasoning or heat in the sauce at all.  It was like eating spongy cardboard with a mushy center. My friend said her food was good but honestly, we were astonished by the service. We sat down to eat at 9:15. We finished eating around 10 and waited for the server to come by to offer us to-go boxes and bring the check. We sat and talked, our plates obviously finished, no longer eating, until 10:40 when I finally flagged him over to bring us to-go boxes and the checks. He brought the to-go boxes and then vanished again. We boxed up our leftovers and waited, but no check arrived. At almost 11 he resurfaced and I flagged him down again and asked for the checks again. He said ""Oh, no one brought them to you? Sorry!"" and went to get the card machine and brought it to us. The food is a little pricey - my appetizer of fried tofu was $20 plus tip and the mandatory fee for using a debit card (we actually used Apple Pay) and while the portion size was generous I can't say the flavor or the service is going to make us come back. I know there's better food in Thai Town.","5241 Hollywood Blvd Los Angeles, CA 90027",3.8,671,Thai,$$
212,2023-09-16,2023-09-17,ixlb DimSum Eats- Hollywood,"The reason that ixlb DimSum Eats - Hollywood does not get five stars is because they absolutely refuse to alter anything in their menu - they even refuse to cut up the Chinese sausage in the Bento Box, even though, technically, it is NOT any kind of substitution (I wanted to order the Bento Box for a person who could not eat large pieces of food, thus the request to cut up the Chinese sausage). I even spoke to the Manager, who absolutely refused. So, I ended up NOT placing a $65 order - their loss.Compare this to any other Chinese restaurant, most of which will customize their menus for the diner.We have not gone back to ixlb DimSum Eats since the infamous ""Chinese sausage"" incident. There is a really good upscale dim sum restaurant in Studio City which has a much larger selection of dim sum and is an actual restaurant, as well as a section for counter service to-go orders (that restaurant is Shanghai Rose).It is a shame about the lack of flexibility at ixlb DimSum Eats, because they have good dimsum, and I used to drive in from Monterey Park (to pick up large orders for several people) because I preferred ixlb DimSum Eats' dimsum to dimsum from various restaurants in the San Gabriel Valley (which is saying something, because the SGV is known as a great area to get Chinese food!)One thing that I loved is the turnip cake - it is very flavorful, but I suspect it might only be ordered by those people who are open to Chinese food that is not ""Americanized."" You can find turnip cakes in Chinatown in authentic dimsum restaurants.ixlb DimSum Eats is an upscale version of those authentic dimsum restaurants. The hargow and shrimp and chives dumplings are delicious. The sticky rice ball was disappointing: hard and with pieces of uncooked rice - we only ordered it once, and never again. Instead, we would order the seafood pearl, which is similar, but the rice is sticky and SOFT. The curry puffs are good, but extremely greasy. The Smiling Fish Bun is a take on Bao, in an open-faced style. It is good! But if you want just the same fried fish without the Bao and toppings, you can get the Fried Fish Fillet which has 2 pieces of fish and a side of the same sauce that is in the Smiling Fish Bun (the Smiling Fish Bun only has 1 piece of fish).Parking is horrendous around ixlb DimSum Eats. There is a very small parking lot behind the restaurant (parallel to Sunset) and very little street parking. There is an Arby's nearby with a larger parking lot, but I don't know if they will tow away cars if they see people parking there and NOT going inside Arby's. I would wait to go to ixlb DimSum Eats until after 8pm just so I could find parking.In sum, the only reason I give ixlb DimSum Eats only 3 stars is their lack of customer concern and lack of flexibility (it would have taken less than 2 minutes to cut up Chinese sausage for the Bento Box ... ).

Perhaps they could have included a bit extra sauces and condiments for the dishes (such as sweet sauce for the spring rolls), but hardly a huge complaint given how everything was.Pork Siu Mai - PACKED with meat and veg, this is perfectly seasoned and just explodes in your mouth. One order was 4 pcs and enough for a good portion of a 2 person meal. That said...I bought 2 orders for 2 people and am happy I was indulgent ;)Xio Long Bao - My comparison point in Cal is Din Tai Fung and these dumplings held up to the competition - for a fraction of the price. DTF's version has more soup and fills your mouth with hot broth immediately, while ixlb's are more subtle, but more than make up in flavor what they perhaps lack in soupy KA-POWness.Shrimp Wontons - Again 4 per order and that's plenty! Absolutely yummy, came with most crispiness remaining (not bad for a few mile trip!) and their chili sauce is solid. Seems like at least two shrimp (or a beautifully tasty and huge single) in this monster. Loved this dish.We also ordered the fried shrimp balls (odd texture at first, then that rich flavor takes over and you're transported to another, kinder, place). Spring Rolls were hot and fresh and delicious (see note about sauce above), and the Cha Siu was fine, definitely have had better in town, but I primarily ordered to make my own fried rice later in the week, so fine by me.No comments on ambiance of actual store as only delivery so far, but this is definitely my new GO-TO (or COME-FROM) spot of Dim Sum in Hollywood and mid-city!","5900 Sunset Blvd Los Angeles, CA 90028",4.4,953,"Dim Sum, Hong Kong Style Cafe",$$

I've tried almost all of them and they are so comforting and tasty yet simple and hits the spot when you just want a filling snack.,"5900 Sunset Blvd Los Angeles, CA 90028",4.4,953,"Dim Sum, Hong Kong Style Cafe",$$
213,2023-09-12,2023-09-17,Tsukemen Aizen,"I came here after exploring Little Tokyo nearby because a friend recommended it. It seemed like it was still in soft opening or something, but we were starving and willing to try something new. I've only had tsukemen 2-3 times in my life, so I was excited to see how this compared.The ambiance inside was pretty good. Seemed like they were busy. My friend asked the waitress what kind of soup broth the ramen had (miso, shoyu, shio, etc), and the waitress couldn't answer, she just said ""traditional"". But then when further asked, she said that she was still training and still new to the place, so it was understandable.The wait was probably 20-30 minutes before we got our food, which normally wouldn't be a problem but we were definitely starving at that point.We all ended up getting the Tsukemen since it was in the name of the restaurant. To be honest, it was a bit underwhelming. The meat was almost like....deli meat you'd find at the grocery store, or in a charcuterie platter. I was expecting like actual chasu that you'd find in ramen typically. But maybe it was a different style? Also the soup was a bit salty for my taste, but maybe it's supposed to be that way. Either way, it wasn't my favorite thing, and by the end I wish I had tried the ramen instead.Overall, it was an okay experience. Not sure if I'd come back, but if I happen to be in the area and wanting noodles, I'll probably try the ramen. I'm sure the service might be better next time too given our waiter isn't someone who is still training.","232 E 2nd St Ste B Los Angeles, CA 90012",4.6,7,"Ramen, Noodles",
213,2023-09-07,2023-09-17,Tsukemen Aizen,"Ate here for lunch today and really enjoyed the food! I ordered the small Tsuekemen Original and was super impressed at not only the portion, but how beautifully plated it was. The broth was rich and flavorful, and the entire meal was delicious! Will be back for more.","232 E 2nd St Ste B Los Angeles, CA 90012",4.6,7,"Ramen, Noodles",
213,2023-09-07,2023-09-17,Tsukemen Aizen,"Aizen Tsukemen is actually accessible from 2nd St, not San Pedro, as indicated on the map in Yelp. I spent some time locating the entrance and was a bit sweaty by the time I arrived. To my delight, the waitress brought me a glass of ice water as soon as I sat down without me having to ask. Great service!Before my order was served, two trays of condiment were presented to enhance the flavor. The regular deluxe Tsukemen I ordered has a decent amount of noodles and a spectacular display of meat. With the 15% soft opening discount, it is not unaffordable.While the plating is magnificent, there is one problem. The noodles are sitting in the center dip of the plate, half-covered by the cold water draining off from the shimeru process. As a result, the noodles become softened, and the seaweed placed on top of the noodles also softens. Some tsukemen shops use a bamboo strainer to avoid this problem.The ajitama is aggressively marinated and has a dark brown exterior, but the interior is very white suggesting that it's not been soaked for too long. The yolk is pleasantly semi-runny. Besides the thinly sliced pork spread around the plate, there is also shredded pork in the center, and a few pieces of fatty pork in the broth. It made me wonder if this could be a viable option for a protein-based diet.The broth is bonito-based and tastes similar to the one at Tsujita. It's not piping hot either. Overall, I enjoy the thick, al dente noodles at Tsujita more. The array of condiments didn't do much to alter the flavor; perhaps I'm too modest in using them.At the end of the meal, I was given a small glass of mint lemonade to cleanse my palate. A nice touch. The atmosphere is trendy and clean, although there are some gnats flying around the shop. Considering the location of the restaurant, I don't find it too offensive. I guess no gentrification can clean this part of town up.","232 E 2nd St Ste B Los Angeles, CA 90012",4.6,7,"Ramen, Noodles",

My husband got the beef and onion and I got the char siu rice, which was supposed to be their most popular dish and I cannot see how, with how bland it was. It was just plain rice, a few pickled vegetables, and pork slices lightly coated in some sort of sauce.

The egg custard sandwiched by two slices of bread double battered is perfection. Also really enjoyed their mango lychee tea which wasn't overly sweet. Their side dishes and green beans were a nice balance for fiber as well.

The fish was fried perfectly with flakey bites and crisp outside. I got to try some my friends shrimp and grits and oxtail taco. Both very good.Definitely a great spot that I would love to return to and try some of the other stuff on their menu. There are a lot of desserts there that I would like to try as well.

Good service and really fresh sushi but my tempura vegetables were way too undercooked. Would really love to come here more often, but considering the prices we won't.

Very nicely designed and a nice general vibe. Good music too.- that said, the acoustics were horrible and we could barely hear each other talk without excessively shouting over the chaotic din. But I understand this is a sacrifice for a beautiful space and lively crowd.- service was very good, friendly and attentive, helpful and knowledgeable about the menu.- the food was very good, but the menu felt a little generic for LA without any strong unifying concept. Any Spanish inspiration seems to get washed out by an aggressive Californianization which makes it feel like every other LA restaurant of this type regardless of regional inspiration. We appreciated all the fresh and high quality ingredients, but the overall experience didn't seem proportional to the bill we paid at the end.","3705 Sunset Blvd Los Angeles, CA 90026",4.2,101,"Spanish, Tapas/Small Plates, Wine Bars",$$

The outdoor seating area was nicely decorated and would be a nice place to chill at night. The food was good but we thought the service could be better.From the beginning, it took awhile for someone to take our order. The set includes fried rice, which is cooked on the same grill after you are done with your meats. After we finished our bbq, no one came to check in on us to see if we would like to order more or if we were ready for our fried rice. We had to flag the staff down multiple times to remind them and we were kept waiting for so long that the oil and remaining vegetables were burnt. When I pointed that out, they did replace the grill for us but we were disappointed the fried rice wouldn't be cooked with all the good meat essence from our bbq (and as expected the fried rice tasted blend).I think for the price point, the service could be better and the staff could be more attentive.

222,2023-09-07,2023-09-17,Mun Patio,"First order of business when arriving in LA is always K-BBQ. Although there are so many options in Ktown, since the weather was quite warm, we thought Mun Patio would be perfect on a hot day.We were a bit unsure if we were supposed to go through the front entrance or if the patio had a separate entrance. Since we arrived a couple minutes before opening, we decided to walk around the building to kill some time and found a side entrance with a sign so we peeked in. Although we were STILL early, we were welcomed to take a seat on the patio. The sun was still out but there were several tables in the shade. The tables were situated far from the street entrance so the hustle and bustle of the street is blocked. String lights were hung above, which I would imagine would be beautiful later in the evening.The patio menu is limited, but you are allowed to order from the inside menu. The patio menu includes 3 different meat options, 3 noodle items, and 3 stews/ramen. For 3 people, we ordered the pork set (port shoulder, pork jowl, and pork belly), which comes with fried rice for $65 and added one order of the Kkodorri noodles (definitely recommend). This was the perfect amount of food for us. There was a DIY ramen station if that's what you're craving after some drinks.Our server cooked all of our meat for us and even grilled the kimchi (and potato!), which I love. He recommended what sauces to pair with which meats, which were all great in my opinionThe prices are more than reasonable for the service and quality, especially compared to other K-BBQ places in the vicinity.

We tried all three pork, and they were all so good. We also had Golbaengi Noodles, and this was also good. It's not the typical spicy golbaengi noodles though.I just loved the ambiance.

They are banchan is super fresh and pairs well with everything that is so served on the menu.The service here are so sweet and attentive! As a Southern girl, hospitality is a major component in rating a restaurant and mun patio exceeded my expectations! Shout out to Esther and the servers for making my experience at mun well worth the drive from the west side!!The space is out in the courtyard with a bunch of tables, portable grills and in the corner they have a self service room and bar, which is complementary for guest who eat at the patio.I wasn't able to grab a picture, but at the end they make you the famous Korean fried rice with the meat, and a bunch of cheese!This is a great place to have get together's with your friends or go on a date. Also, I forgot to mention their drinks are phenomenal!Just a little tip on the weekends they don't take reservations so I'll try to come for an early dinner so you don't have to wait !

223,2023-09-09,2023-09-17,Kuya Lord,"Really cannot say enough good things about Kuya Lord. From the food to the service to the quality to the coziness of the dining room - it's all five stars across the board from me.I'd actually never heard of this spot before heading up to the LA area for a work trip. The guy I was with, though, he not only knew about Kuya Lord but was very excited for us to try it out. Luckily, we had a couple of hours to kill between events and this place was close enough for a quick lunch.The dining room was pretty packed when we arrived, though ""pretty packed"" here means there were two larger parties already posted up at their tables. The dining area is tight, so be prepared.We decided to share a couple dishes: the Lechon Kawali rice bowl (pork belly, rice, salad, $25) and the Beef Tocino bowl (short ribs with egg, $26). We also each got a glass of their honey calamansi juice ($7 each) and - because we're crazy - decided to share the calamansi pie $(10.50).The first bites of the Lechon rice bowl instantly transported me to my youth, to being in a family kitchen with my mom and aunties, to hearing my uncles talking about the proper marinade for the beef, the best way to sear in the flavors, the perfect pairings as sides. The Tocino bowl made me pause - beef still whole on my tongue - to appreciate the complexity of the flavors and the juiciness of the meat.To say we both enjoyed the meals would be an understatement. We're still talking about the food to this day - and this was only the second meal we'd ever shared together. The power of good food, man! Building relationships and memories without even trying.The honey calamansi juice was refreshing, a bit tart and slightly sweet. The calamansi pie was...well, it was a bit much after all that food. We got through a quarter of it before having to tap, but it had a nice bite from the calamansi, and a smooth texture to the filling. I wish we could have taken it back with us, but we had several more hours in the car before we could get back to our hotel, so that wasn't an option.We both very much enjoyed our quick (though slightly expensive) meal here and acknowledge our new friendship was built over the dishes and the conversations we had while in the dining room.","5003 Melrose Ave Los Angeles, CA 90038",4.4,178,"Barbeque, Filipino, Noodles",$$

All the flavors paired well with each other. Lechon was perfectly cooked and the Java rice had such good garlic taste.The noodles were slightly too rich and got saltier the more I ate.

224,2023-07-11,2023-09-17,Angry Chickz,"I've tried Howlin' Ray's, Dave's Hot Chicken, and Angry Chickz.If I were to rate each of these places SOLELY based on taste (of the chicken and not anything else), I'd give Howlin' a 10, Angry Chickz a 9.5, and Dave's an 8.Service wise, Dave's takes the win, but Howlin' is a close second.Accessibility wise, Dave's wins by default cus it has the most locations and stays open the latest depending on the location you go to.Wait wise, Angry Chickz takes the win.Parking wise, I've never had an issue finding a spot at Angry Chickz.If I were to compare these places based on sides, then Angry Chickz has my vote because their cole slaw, pickles, mac n cheese, and buttery rice are FIRE! Plus, I don't like bread (which is why I mainly stick to tenders), so the fact that they offer rice is a complete game changer.Fries from all three places are equally good.Other than flavor, 2 reasons why Howlin' Ray's has an advantage over the other two:1) It travels slightly better than the other two (I've dined in and ordered take out from all 3 places)2) For Angry Chickz and Dave's, if you order anything above medium or hot, the flavor significantly goes down and the spice overpowers the taste. However, with Howlin', I've ordered every spice level on the spectrum (even howlin', which put me in pain for 3.5 days), and as spicy as the food may have been,I was still always able to taste the flavor.But anyway, I'll say this.If I were doing take out, I'd choose Howlin over Angry Chickz. If I were dining in, it'd just be a coin toss between the two.

Chef Minh Phan curates her menu so thoughtfully, and to watch her in the kitchen is to watch an artist and chef building every dish with love. The mochi dish is not only delicious but an event that awes and inspires (I didn't take a pic so as not to ruin the surprise). Excited to see what the future brings for this chef and her food.","1370 N St Andrews Pl Los Angeles, CA 90028",4.4,21,Diners,$$$$
225,2022-10-06,2023-09-17,Phenakite,"Phenakite has returned in a super stealth, under the radar multi course fashion inside of the Forest from the Trees art installation in East downtown Los Angeles.You are shocked when you refresh the Phenakite Tock for your daily check to see if they are back and serving and see actual reservations. You make one with no hesitation or care about the cost.The no-publicity approach seems to be destined to keep things on the DL. There appears to be a single seating for just five tables per night. It's all inclusive, food, tip and alcohol paid for when you make the reservation on Tock.The evening begins with a non-alcoholic yuzu drink while you wait for a private time in the art installation. Unusually everyone at your dinner has arrived early or on time (besides a party that no-showed, shockingly). Which left some lag in the schedule as the art installation has some time padded in. You enjoy the cool air and the opening of the exhibit where a series of microphones have been cleverly changed into small speakersThat experience is great; and interesting, however the real magic begins when you slip into a gallery esque dining room. Five tables all facing a kitchen where Chef Minh Phan works with her team composing a multi course meal. You might say it's nine or ten courses but some of the courses include multiple small dishes so you wouldn't argue if the chef told you it was a 15- or 16-course meal.Thematically the idea is tied to that of the art exhibit, indigenous foods (tho not religiously, like you might find at Owamni - The Sioux Chef, in Minneapolis), no waste, and the heartfelt imaginative cooking of the chef herself that is unlike any other in Los Angeles.Her laptop sits nearby connected with an aux cable to a speaker. It keeps turning off as the laptop goes to sleep and the chef fiddles with it to restart her playlist of 90s and 00s indie rock and alternative. Wilco and the Magnetic Fields serenade you.The walls are stark white with gallery lighting and a few branches screwed into them, but some have fallen. The wooden tables are decorated in a way that's elegant but also homey and reminiscent of how your mom or aunt might.And then the food. Bold at every step. Looking at past Phenakite menus you see some of her themes, a blowtorch (which ties wonderfully to the art exhibit) lights filled mochi and a fig leaf on fire, creating smoke and ash that drifts over the table during the course.Fauna of the forest with a flavor profile that is dreamlike. Different stems and pieces that might be thrown away used and pickled.A series of small dishes including a three sisters dish, a crab cake with the perfect season of dill and tarragon, pickles from the sea to go with it.  The lone dish of the night that fails to live up to its brothers and sisters is a shrimp with an elegant birds nest of root and tuber tempura fried on top of it. Salty and beautiful but pales compared to the flavors of everything else you are served. Perhaps that misses the point, and the salt is there to cleanse the palette.A fish dish with a medley of flavors and vegetables and perfectly splayed out fried mushrooms. The porridge course that one expects and loves from the beloved chef behind Porridge + Puffs. Two remarkable bites of venison with bright seasoning and mouthing numbing qualities.A course called a Dance Party that again minimizes the waste from the kitchen. Followed by a staple herbal granita and a crème desert.Throughout the meal alcohol pairings were served. They match the food beautifully and you make note of new wineries to check out in Santa Barbara next time .The service is warm and enthusiastic. The servers when introducing themselves reveal that they are an art student and an actress. It's at once surprising, revealing and excusing. Wines are poured occasionally with no explanation of the vintage and food dropped off without explanation, the menu is on the table so you can read, but the story is slightly lost in these moments. The lack of experience is at once endearing while also occasionally jarring given how remarkable the meal is.You embrace the at times awkward service with the same love and familiarity that the staff and space embrace you and embrace the strange situation they have found themselves in.From the entire time you felt purpose, warmth, and love poured into the meal you've been served. There isn't anything else quite like it, and you feel bad about wanting to tell people about it, as if it being secret could help it exist in its purity for a bit longer.And at the same time, you must talk and tell your friends about it, because you leave changed and touched in a way that few other meals ever accomplish.As you leave the gallery, You wave goodbye to the chef, and wish you could have this first experience all over again for the first time","1370 N St Andrews Pl Los Angeles, CA 90028",4.4,21,Diners,$$$$
225,2021-11-21,2023-09-17,Phenakite,"Had really high hopes for this place after getting LA Times restaurant of the year and a Michelin star. Overall I think the concept was cool but the execution on food and plating was lacking.First, they seat you by order of which you arrived. The weird thing is, they don't take note of who arrived first and go around asking everyone. If you plan on seating by order of arrival, then a staff member should take note to make it an easier transition to the table for the guests. Other than that, I'd say the service was solid.Some of the plating felt a bit too much, random stones on a plate or unneeded rocks. I was able to look past that but the food was just not executed well at all. There was a tempura dish that wasn't crispy, it had no crunch and felt like it was sitting in oil for way too long. The pork belly course was way over cooked. I could see each fiber and I had a tough time cutting into it. The mochi that accompanied the dish was great though. The fish dish was severely overcooked as well, I couldn't take more than a bite. At first, I thought it was just an off night but when I spoke to friends who went prior to me, they all commented similarly. I'm not sure if it's lack of a proper kitchen or what but for $200+ per person, I was expecting a lot more.","1370 N St Andrews Pl Los Angeles, CA 90028",4.4,21,Diners,$$$$

Everything felt near perfect, from the food, to the drinks, to the staff, to the ambiance and serving-ware. It's definitely a splurge meal that should be saved for a special occasion, but for me this is what all fine dining should aspire to be.THE FOOD: They only offer a nine-course set meal. It was a tremendous progression of tastes, flavors and stories that are meant to be a journey through the land, sea, and air. Some items didn't entirely hit, but overall it was a near impeccable journey. One of my few complaints is that they serve a lot of food, but don't let guests take leftovers home...so bring your appetite!THE DRINKS: We shared a beverage paring and it was a great match to the meal and felt like a perfect amount of drinks.THE SPACE: The team somehow transforms the courtyard of a coworking space into a fantastic secluded outdoor garden. It would be nice if they had heaters, but it is protected enough from the elements that it didn't get too cold.This was quite simply my favorite Los Angeles meal / dining experience over the past couple years.HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!","1370 N St Andrews Pl Los Angeles, CA 90028",4.4,21,Diners,$$$$

Service was fantastic as staff are fully explained the ingredients of the dish as well as the intent. One thing that confused us was their requirement to see proof of vaccine when the entire dining area is located outside. I'm not anti-vaxx but I asked why this precaution was mandated when there are no county protocols instructing diners to show show vax proof of eating outdoors.

The food was fresh and vibrant, I liked how they weren't trying to mask the flavor of the ingredients with overly rich sauces and spices. They let the quality ingredients speak for themselves.

Waited for 45 minutes for a table but we'll worth it. The staff is amazing and very attentive. We had a bottle of wine while we waited for our table. . There were 3 of us. We got a dozen oysters,crudo, the bread with anchovies, lobster roll, and scallop tostada to share. All of the food  was delicious. They also had my favorite key lime pie.

227,2023-09-11,2023-09-17,Found Oyster,"I am from New England, and have a pretty high bar for raw seafood. Found Oyster is very good. Their oysters are flown in, and kept quite fresh, offering great taste and served with excellent condiments/garnishes. Other items on the menu are tasty as well, and definitely worth exploring.The wait staff was friendly and attentive, without being pushy for you to leave so they could clear space for additional customers.The only reason I have excluded Found Oyster from the 5 star ranking is because of its prices and physical space. While the food was good, the price point was a bit high considering what it is at many other seafood places I have eaten at. (Ones that are actually by the water where the oysters are 20 min old) It's also tiny inside, which I realize is simply the space they have to operate....but it feels cluttered and definitely affects the overall dining experience.Overall, it's worth a visit if you like this kind of fare.","4880 Fountain Ave Los Angeles, CA 90029",4.4,320,Seafood,

227,2023-09-02,2023-09-17,Found Oyster,"Amazing! I started following FO on Instagrams few year ago and I was able to visit twice before covid hit. I easily fell in love! I was able to order during the first weeks of covid when they only had a walk up window and visited a few times post with the new ""deck"".I love oysters and raw bars, but in LA I've never found a place I liked as much as Lure in NYC, Swan in SF or the Walrus and the Carpenter in Seattle. Till now!!The menu is a small but I love this because this means it's all fresh! I really wanted to order one of everything but always some raw oysters. They have specials depending on season like razor clams, shrimp etc. You can't go wrong with anything from the menu, it's all fantastic. The scallop tostada is orgasmic and the Sicilian crudo is to die for!!","4880 Fountain Ave Los Angeles, CA 90029",4.4,320,Seafood,
227,2023-09-02,2023-09-17,Found Oyster,"I'd had a rough day today, and there's just nothing to lift my spirits like sitting at a bar with some raw oysters and a glass of wine. So I headed over to try Found Oyster on my way home, hoping for a lively but casual environment where I could just sit by myself at the bar and enjoy my surroundings.First of all, parking is a challenge before 7 p.m. (when restrictions are lifted on Sunset) and if you're going to be there past 6 p.m., when neighborhood permit-only parking takes effect. Timing-wise, it's probably best to arrive at Found Oyster when it opens at 4 and spend a couple of hours and then get your car out of there. After circling the surrounding blocks for about 20 minutes around 5:30 p.m. on a Friday, I finally found an unrestricted spot about 0.2 miles away, but I was almost ready to give up.When I arrived, there were already people spilling out onto the sidewalk, waiting for tables. The restaurant has a bench and some chairs next to their outdoor seating that are dedicated specifically for people on the waitlist, and the nice thing is that someone will come out and take your wine order so you can get the party started before you're officially seated. I, however, got lucky and took the last seat at the end of the bar.When you first order, you check off boxes on a double-sided paper menu, kind of like you do in a sushi restaurant. Remember to check the chalk board behind the bar to see the day's specials, including the oysters of the day.I ordered a dozen oysters, half and half of the two varieties -- but unfortunately it was so loud in there (the music was turned up WAY high, and the restaurant was full) that I couldn't quite hear which oysters were which when they arrived. They both tasted fresh and not too briney, and I really loved the cocktail sauce that came with it, which tasted house-made. (The mignonette was not my favorite, as I prefer more of a red wine vinegar style and less leafy green bits in it.) There's also some Louisiana hot sauce bottles on the bar, if you like that sort of thing.To accompany my oysters I also ordered the Bub & Grandma's bread and butter appetizer. The bread was dense and grilled to a crisp -- I like really toasty toast so it was OK for me, but some might consider it overdone. It had been thoroughly oiled, so it actually didn't really need the soft salted butter splotch that had been added to the plate. Being the butter fiend that I am, I ate it all anyway -- then again, others might think it's too much.I rounded out my meal with the wedge salad, which was a very generous portion. The bacon on top wasn't crispy, but more like lardons -- thick, cubed pieces of very dense, meaty bacon with a strong flavor. The stilton blue cheese was very good, but the dressing itself was more of a plain buttermilk and landed a little flat for me. I loved the tiny sliced tomatoes on top, they really added some farmers market freshness to the dish.I would normally have stayed longer and hung out, but it was SO HOT inside -- 92 degrees, as reported by one of the staffers. No one apologized for the heat, but I can only assume the A/C broke. It was legit windy in there with all the fans going (I had to put my hair in a pony for it not to blow into my food) but it was really uncomfortable still.Also the wine is pretty expensive for a 4-ounce pour in small glasses, and there's no Diet Coke offered -- only Mexican Sprite. (I don't know if they have Mexican Coke, they told me they only had Sprite.) And the bottle of tap water I was given when I sat down just wasn't cold enough to be refreshing. So I took off once I finished my food, which I was definitely full from.On the positive front, the food came out very quickly, and even when my server forgot to put in my wine order, it was remedied right away and they admitted their mistake. I felt so bad for everybody working there, suffering through the heat -- and I really admired how they weren't audibly complaining about it.","4880 Fountain Ave Los Angeles, CA 90029",4.4,320,Seafood,
227,2023-08-30,2023-09-17,Found Oyster,I loved the freshness of the seafood we had at FO.  Their oysters come from a family farm in MA.  They also have fresh oysters from other sources.All dishes we tried were excellent albeit scant--most notably the lobster roll.  I've never had a lobster roll this small. I'd rather pay more for a healthy portion of lobster.Service was excellent and super helpful.Tip:  FO is a small resto-- small like Hog Island Oyster in San Fran and Neptune Oyster in Boston. At FO there's  a bar and 2 seater tables inside.  Parties of 2+ get about 6  outside tables.,"4880 Fountain Ave Los Angeles, CA 90029",4.4,320,Seafood,

227,2023-08-28,2023-09-17,Found Oyster,"Dined here on Sunday (8/27) at 6:30PM.I rarely leave yelp reviews, but dining at this place was incredibly sensational and emotional I had to publicize my experience. I started seeing accounts on Instagram rave about the smoked trout dip and I'd like every photo of their Sicilian crudo that would show up on my feed. Needless to say, this place was bookmarked. I currently reside in Marina del Rey and avoid driving to the east side at all costs, but I decided to suck it up and make that 45 minute drive over. I had no idea what I was in for. We got to dine outside, which suited the seafood feast we had. It was near sunset so the golden hour was alive and well. Our servers were so passionate and informed about the menu items, that we had full confidence and excitement in everything we ordered.Melon De Burgogne ($58) - Bright, crisp, refreshing! We were able to order and enjoy this wine while waiting for our table. Drink with oysters and sunshine!Overboard Platter ($161) - ""Life's short, get the seafood platter!"" was the statement of the evening. Jaws were on the floor when this tower was placed on our table. 18 of the freshest oysters imaginable, peel & eat prawns that packed a punch of flavor, the buttery, melt in your mouth, delectable Sicilian crudo, and a crab cocktail dip that was so meaty, LIKE ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!Smoked Trout Dip ($23) - The first bite of this brought tears to my eyes. I have never tasted anything like it, I still don't know how to explain the flavor. They made something so simple have so much depth and complexity. A ritz cracker was the perfect vessel for this delicious dip.Bub & Grandma's Bread ($8) + White Anchovies ($5) - That bread was the main character! She was so buttery and the perfect ratio of toasted layer to soft warm bread. The anchovies were also very necessary. It elevated a simple bread and butter starter to an entrée level menu item.Scallop Tostada ($19) - I could have eaten 3 of these. Strong yuzu and basil flavors were the ideal companion to the rich taste of this mollusk legend. A must order.Lobster Bisque Roll ($33) - How are you going to go to a seafood forward establishment and not get their signature lobster roll? it's impossible. But boy oh boy, no regrets whatsoever. They did not skimp on the lobster and the bun was so light, soft, and buttery. It was perfect.Fried Cod Sandwich ($17) - We couldn't not try their seasonal special. C'mon. Amazing quality fish, fried with a thin crispy layer of batter. The sauce. Not sure if it's tartar or some sort of aioli (I forgot), but it complimented the fish perfectly. They made a fried fish sandwich refreshing with some tang. So simple, so delicious.","4880 Fountain Ave Los Angeles, CA 90029",4.4,320,Seafood,

229,2023-09-04,2023-09-17,Hearts & Flame,"Another cute but ""just okay"" Italian spot in Art's District. Nothing super special about the menu. We were a larger group, so people ordered different things and lots of appetizers, but not one of us thought our food was good. The dishes either felt over salted or bland to us.  I think we liked sides and the appetizers more than the pastas. The guy taking our order even told my friend to not order one of the pasta dishes because he didn't think it was good.Also, the wait staff didn't seem like they liked their job or maybe they were confused. I don't know if it was because we were a big ""younger"" looking group or something, but it felt like our waiter didn't want to serve our group or just didn't have good communication skills. He didn't really talk to us nicely.My friend did valet here because it was a Saturday night, and parking in this area is just terrible. After dinner, we had wandered next door to get some ice cream nearby, so my friend left his car with the valet for maybe 30 minutes after we left the restaurant, but when we returned, we didn't see the valet guy, and the wait staff told us that the valet was closed...when it was actually not. We called the number at the valet post, and nobody picked up. Luckily, the valet guy returned like 15 minutes afterwards (he was grabbing a car). I don't know why the waiter would tell us that...because not only did the waiter not help us...but he put us in unnecessary panic for a little bit.","225-227 S Garey St Los Angeles, CA 90012",4.1,178,Italian,$$$

229,2023-08-19,2023-09-17,Hearts & Flame,"What a horrible experience!!!!We booked a party of 8 here for my birthday and I will never come back here again. It started out well, good ambiance, clean, nicely lit, but our experience quickly deteriorated after.I should have known something was off when our waiter asks if there are any dietary restrictions and then says okay well I'll tell you your options later and never did. Then before he leaves the table says ""it'll be better for me if one person places the orders for everyone."" I'm sorry but 6 adults and 2 children is not a very large group. We placed our orders and waited and waited and waited. Twice they came by and said the food is coming, but never a when, or a sorry for the wait, or would you like a round of drinks for the table? We waited an hour and a half for our meals. While tables that arrived after us received their entrees.Everyone was so hungry that they ate the food that was delivered underprepared. We had raw underdone pasta dishes and my filet was completely rare and bloody when I requested medium. Now what really made the night horrible, the waiter comes to the table and says to my husband, ""I told you that it would have helped to order family style"" blaming us for the poor service. I looked at him and said that is just an excuse and putting the blame on us for ordering individual meals is poor customer service, he tried to argue back to which I said to him to just stop arguing, apologize and stop making excuses and if he could bring us the check so we can pay and leave.About 10 minutes after, a young lady comes to the table and apologizes and says she will take 10% off the bill. I said thank you we would just like to pay. When the bill came it had 10% taken off and a 20% gratuity added!!!What a terrible experience, poor service, undercooked food, lousy wait times and too expensive for this quality.

Will definitely be back hope to see Victor and the rest of the team who made our visits memorable. Also loved their Barbie themed menu.

No cushion available on the back of the banquet and the tables were positioned close together, so the noise level was extreme.Our server told us that it was a ""shared plate"" restaurant and although portions were large we should order 2-3 plates each. All the servings were tiny! Entrees were very small and didn't come with any side vegetables or extras, yet you were charged for a full main dish. We ordered the eggplant as our main. It took 45 minutes to get our meal. There were two tiny stuffed (more like a garnish)  Japanese eggplants on the plate.  I saw other ""mains""that were equally as small.

The fried sweet potato was soooo good and the tomato toast is a must!It's a cute little restaurant with simple decor.

231,2023-07-09,2023-09-17,HanShik Express,"Only reason I give this place one star is because there's no option to select zero star!Based on the customer service we received from this Asian girl staff, made me and my partner to walk out of the restaurant.When we selected Korean spicy rib as one of the entree option, she was filling up dinner box with bones with no meat on it. We sincerely asked her if that option can be replace with other menu since only bones are left and she said ""I can't because I already put this food (several pieces of bones) on the dinner box and that can't be replace with other menu option.""We were just appalled by her response and decided to walk out the restaurant.Isn't it common sense that if there are no meat and only bones are left, staff needs to take it off from food menu and inform customer that it's sold out and have them select different entree.If that selection was a fish entree, I bet she would give me fish bones and would tell me that she can't take it off because I chose that option and once that bones are put it into the dinner box, you can't take it off nor replace with other menu.I am just really upset how this ignorant and imprudently trained staff could treat customer with this type manner. We are paying for not only good food but service as well.How are some of these Elite Yelp reviewers gave this place five stars.To restaurant owner or staff manager:I stopped by your restaurant at 7/7/24 Friday at 6:00pm.

The main picture was well put together line up of YAKITORI which quickly caught my eye. Im a huge fanatic of Japanese food as my name is from Japan. Yesterday on the day of my reservation which was set for 7:30pm I had an unplanned event pop up so I had to call in and reschedule for 8pm. Jaime answered the phone and was so kind, he made me changing my reservation easy and breezy.Walking up to the place I noticed how modern yet elegant it is, the ambiance is relaxing and chill with lots of fabulous smells. Jaime greeted us with a smile and some laughs and had the chefs table available for us along with some complimentary sake shots to start off our dinner. He let us know all about the menu and what the most popular dishes currently were.Very quickly the Manager Ray introduced himself and the young beautiful chef Sophia. Ray let us know that the specialty item was the Tako Taco he was very helpful as ever dish came out he offered us a story, I really enjoyed this since it felt like I was brought closer to each item of the menu.As for food items we went all out and ordered, I'm going to name them in order which I loved the most form best to least.1.

232,2023-09-11,2023-09-17,HATCH,"This is a nice and premium feeling yakitori place.You can find this restaurant inside of an upscale shopping mall. There are Outdoor, indoor, and bar seats, all of which you can choose from. We walked over from a close-by apartment, so I can't speak to parking or public transit, but I believe there is a subway station close-by. We visited on a Saturday evening and were able seat right away without a reservation.There were plates, sides, and raw portions of the menu, but we were there for the yakitori. There's also an interesting cocktail menu. The yakitori menu had a pretty extensive selection. I opted for the pork belly, and skirt steak & wasabi. the price difference was drastic, with pork belly being 6, vs skirt steaks 18. The latter sounded interesting and I wanted to say I at least tried it. I also ordered an IPA that I haven't heard of before.The bartender assisting us was very knowledgeable of the drinks menu and was able to help my sister in finding a drink that she might like. We also got to see him make the cocktail in front of us. The drinks didn't take too long to be ready for us. The yakitori however did take a little bit longer than we were expecting. You can see the kitchen, and it doesn't look like there are many spots to grill the skewers, so maybe that's why.The pork belly was delicious. Something about the sauce that it was covered in, really brought out the taste. I did save the more expensive skewer for last, but I ended up being a little disappointed in the skirt steak, because there wasn't as much flavor as I was expecting, given the price. Maybe it was the wasabi, as I think it is real wasabi, and not the one you would see at your everyday sushi restaurant. The wasabi didn't add much to the taste, and I like wasabi. With that being said, if I were to come back, I'd rather get 3 pork bellies as opposed to 1 skirt steak.This was a really nice experience. Minus the wait and the high expectations of a more expensive menu item, this is definitely worth the visit.

I don't necessarily judge an establishment by their miso, but if your miso isn't good...I lose hope for the rest of the food. So, this was a nice preview.The next item was the avo tuna toast which is wild caught tuna, yuzu smashed avocado, crispy rice, green onion, house togarashi. The yuzu definitely stood out, but maybe a bit much for my taste personally, but the tuna was good and the crispy rice was toasted nicely.The chicken meatball, pork skewers and the mushroom skewers came out next...loved the chicken meatball and the sauce it came with. The pork belly was good, but a bit salty and so were the mushrooms. I couldn't finish the mushrooms...Then, my personal favorite, the black chicken karaage...black because of the squid ink, cooked perfectly...crispy outside with a nice crunch, tender on the inside and that black garlic ranch...chef's kiss!There was also broccolini with fried garlic that was another favorite, and an onigiri that was meh (you can pass on this if you're ordering a la carte).The staff was attentive but not overbearing...Becky, you were amazing!Definitely check out the extensive Japanese whiskey selection and their cocktails!

232,2023-08-14,2023-09-17,HATCH,"Came to Hatch for dinner on a Thursday! Made a reservation, but I probably would have been able to get a table without one.FLAVOR (3.5/5):1. AVO TUNA TOAST: The server recommended this one and photos of it on yelp caught my eye... but the flavor was underwhelming and tasted like something you could make at home.2. CORN TEMPURA TOWER: Good, tastes like your standard corn tempura. Not sure it makes sense for the price though.3. UNAGI: Unagi was good and tender - tbh, I prefer it on sushi rather than yakitori, but it comes with crispy rice on top for varied texture.4. PORK BELLY: The pork belly is a thicker cut and was cooked well.5. BEEF TONGUE: I've never had a thick cut of beef tongue, but was pleasantly surprised. The umami flavor was good and it was really tender.6. SKIRT STEAK & WASABI: The two skewers we got were different sizes of meat and my friend's skewer ended up tender while mine was dry. Flavor-wise, the wasabi isn't very strong and doesn't add much to the skewer. Can't really justify this for 18 dollars.7. SQUID INK KARAAGE: Previous reviews raved about this dish, but I don't see the appeal. Don't get me wrong, the chicken was tender and had a nice crispy batter, but it's nothing super special. Tastes like good chicken karaage.8. BLACK FRIED RICE: The black fried rice was probably my favorite out of everything we ordered. I liked the salty flavor profile and thought it paired well with the karaage.9. GREEN TEA HIGHBALL: I liked this drink! I mentioned I wanted something smooth and this was recommended to me by the server. Would definitely get this again.SERVICE (5/5):Service was good.AMBIENCE (5/5):Intimate and cute. Would recommend coming in on a busier day like Friday or a weekend for the atmosphere.PARKING (4/5):Garage parking and Hatch validates. We didn't stay for very long, but still had a small charge (I think one dollar).TAKEAWAYS:Hatch was good, but its yakitori is not my favorite, especially for the price point.

233,2023-07-09,2023-09-17,Wolvesmouth at the Wolvesden,"One of my foodie friends found this pop up restaurant a while ago, and because I love experiencing new food, we got a small group to try.The exterior is stunning, a house covered with lush greenery and the open indoor concept that's rustic and wooden...just wow  There's full accessibility to to see the chefs in the kitchen, and one long table for guests to be seated together like a supper club. Love the ambiance from the decor, to meeting new friends, and with BYOB option.The service in between each course was efficient & smooth, and included good introductions of food. They don't provide as much showmanship or more conversation as other supper clubs/pop ups I've been to would have, but it's still good service.The first of the six courses started off super strong with a tender ribeye cap & perfect gnocchi, but afterwards were some hit and misses as expected with the experimental nature of this spot. The duck ravioli flavor was exquisite and the presentation is incredibly colorful, but the duck itself was a bit dry. The fish dishes were yummy, but the creative presentation actually covered up the beautiful ingredients in my personal opinion. The albacore flavor reminded me of a Tom yum and was interesting. Every dish had a lot going on, sometimes too much like the quail and pork belly that was too much after a few bites. The desserts were good, but a little too tart for me.Overall, very fun and beautiful place. The food is what we expect it to be: experimental.

233,2023-04-11,2023-09-17,Wolvesmouth at the Wolvesden,"An intimate private experience with an aggressive and fun prefixe menu, some really delightful culinary highlights, but also some big misses on the details, especially at this price point. I'll start with the good (the first 3 dishes and the 2 deserts were STARS) then with some criticism.Food highlights: You know it's going to be unusual when the first course of an 8 course meal (6 savory, 2 desert) is a ribeye with no punches pulled.  Give the people what they want when they want it (now!), I suppose.  The roman gnocchi is delightfully funky and chewy and stole the show in my book.  It was reminiscent of the best Brazilian cheese bread that I've ever had... savory, funky and a great chew. The focaccia was also a star but the ribeye cap was chewy.Duck raviolo was tasty and gorgeous with a cabbage dust.  I wanted a bit more gaminess from the duck but the presentation and cooking was wonderful. I can't remember if it was this dish or another that had the grilled snap peas but those were the best snap peas I've ever had and should be featured on all of the menus here.Hailbut: what a fun dish! Texture was spot on and presentation was really whimsical.Desert: 5 stars all over! There's a lot going on and I think it all works.  Such great balance of tartness, sweetness, and bitterness.  The blondie could've been better at room temp instead of cold.  Whatever, I'm nitpicking on that.  EVERYONE enjoyed desert and all of the layers and details were tremendously fun.Food misses: We had a heavy menu.  We were forewarned that we may not want to eat everything because a lot of food would be served.  This makes no sense to me.  You have control over coursing and portion.  If you know it tends to be more food than necessary, then edit!  The quail course (which was so tenderly battered and fried) could be halved by only serving one leg instead of two.  The white BBQ sauce was overwhelming and salty and dominated the dish.  A few other dishes were oversauced.  At some point, I wished that the first course were some basic omnipresent crudo instead of a ribeye cap and I was yearning for a palate cleanser after course 2.  .The other misses: Look, I'm going to be critical at this price point.My water glass was cracked. No biggie... I'll grab another.  Then the wine glass that the host gave me was chipped and cut my lip. Boo hoo, it was very little blood, I know.. but it's hard to look past the second strike here.The table is worn particle board with the wood veneer noticeably falling off and the chairs just scream cheap.  I'm not gonna care if the admission ticket itself were cheaper but you expect a certain level of ambiance given the cost.The music is all over the place.  Childish Gambino, followed by Elliott Smith, and some Foo Fighters thrown in for good measure. It felt as random as a Pandora playlist from 2008.The host was unengaged.  Told us what the first course was then said use the QR code for the other 7 courses, which was only posted by the water station under the precariously positioned peacock that everyone kept knocking into.THE CUTLERY.  They ask that you use the same set of utensils for the 6 savory courses.  Look, I don't want you to wash a bunch of utensils and waste water and time either.  But if you're going to serve me a sticky fonduta that I can't clean off my spoon other than by scraping it off with my mouth, then just give me a new spoon.  For ~$200, I don't think 1 more spoon over 6 saucy courses is an unreasonable expectation.In summary, if you're going to spend this much on a pre fixe meal, go to Le Comptoir or Orsa & Winston.  The food will be superior as will the ambiance.  It's almost unfair to say this as Wolvesmouth is a uniquely private dining experience, but I felt like there wasn't the requisite level of thoughtfulness that this price point demands.  I also wouldn't recommend NOT going if you have a group of friends large enough to take up one service.  It was fun taking over the dining table and BYOB was fun.   I hope this crew keeps working it.  There are some real gems on the menu and in each dish and I can't wait to see if this concept changes and becomes something larger.",,4.8,175,Pop-Up Restaurants,$$$$

I am glad they decided to organize their Christmas party this year at the Wolves Den. One of those hidden LA gastronomic jewels that require the knowledge of a secret handshake for you to get on their mailing list. I love the concept of communal dining, where you forget about the surroundings and your focus becomes friendships and gastronomy. Applause to the chef and his amazing crew. Certainly french trained. I can still taste the butter. Loved it!",,4.8,175,Pop-Up Restaurants,$$$$

233,2022-12-11,2023-09-17,Wolvesmouth at the Wolvesden,"The Wolvesmouth experience is so extraordinary and seriously deserve a praise for the idea, execution and story that this crew builds. The process from planning and coordination through arrival is very smooth and bespoke in many ways, where you feel a certain sense of exclusivity. The menu options are pretty much standard or vegetarian, though the team was kind enough to accommodate gluten-limited for 1 in our party.Upon arrival they opened the hidden door and welcomed us into this wooden cottage-like house with beautiful long table. The kitchen seamlessly coexisted with the dining area and was only separated by a small island they used for plating. I loved the furnishing - simplistic and on key, while the corner showed a side table for the bring-your-booze station. That in itself was an amazing addition and really helped us figure out what we wanted to drink, mix in, and complement the food journey.The courses then started arriving 1 by 1. Everything was superbly imaginative, balanced in expected ways, and drove us on a journey across many regions. I was very surprised by the quality, the ample sized portions, and especially the evolution of the dishes. I certainly see this as quite the experience, which was marred only by constant nudges. The entire venue was booked for our private party, and every time a couple of us stepped outside for a cigarette break (that does not take super long after all) the host would eventually appear to usher us in because the food was going cold. I find that they could do so much better in expediting, and not have to force a high single-digit course dinner into 1 hour and 45 minutes. It was unreal how fast they were trying to wrap up. I had not read that this is the pervasive comment from most visitors, and looking back - I do not think it would have changed my mind about visiting, but it really took away a bit from the exclusivity of the experience.",,4.8,175,Pop-Up Restaurants,$$$$

I was very disappointed because I was expecting a lot more especially since it's black-owned and supposed to be comfort food, but no. The only thing that was good here were the drinks but the food was a hard pass. It's primarily set up cafeteria style so you'll be sitting to next to people, but they do have some setting where you can sit solely with your party.

We don't know the area too well, so I'll figure that out next time lol.Service is pretty quick, and it's a small place, but very cozy and nice. The food is delicious! I'm really not a breakfast/brunch person, but this place really changed my mind HAHA. Actually, it was the first time I DIDN'T have an alcoholic beverage with my brunch lol.I ordered the Waffle Fried Chicken Sandwich, and it was everything I wanted! So savory/sweet/spicy all in one, and the chicken was so juicy. I'm not a fan of the super runny yolk, but I think next time I SHOULD get my egg more runny, it jus balanced so well with the meal. Waffle was bomb too!!My favorite part was actually the BRICK HASH! It's so nice to look at lol, but also crunchy and delicious!!!!The blackberry limeade was SO GOOD. The cold brew & matcha were so-so. I would jus stick with the limeades. I really wish I tried their alcoholic drinks because I could only imagine what that limeade with a shot of vodka or champagne would taste like... it would be heaven :')Anyway, if you're looking for a chill place with tasty drinks and food, I would definitely recommend!THANKS FOR READING Y'ALL","765 Wall St Los Angeles, CA 90014",4.0,3193,"Breakfast & Brunch, American (New), Comfort Food",$$

237,2023-09-11,2023-09-17,Nossa Caipirinha Bar,"Had a nice dinner here; sat outside with a girlfriend one evening and split a few items. I'm familiar with traditional Portuguese food more so than Brazilian food so I couldn't help but compare themWe ordered 2 pāo de queijo, and I wish we had gotten 2 more. They were fresh - warm and soft with cheese baked perfectly throughout the bread. Honestly I liked these more than the Portuguese variants I've had which usually include a hard cheese.The grilled pea salad was probably my least favorite of the dishes. The ricotta and peas were nice, but the greens were massive and included a lot of stems. Felt like I was chewing on a full mint sprig constantly.Ordered two skewers to split between the two of us, too. The crispy chicken thigh and the linguiça. The chicken thighs were great, crispy on the inside and very hot and juicy. The linguiça was a bit underwhelming. I love Portuguese linguiça, which tends to be spicier and honestly, heftier. I was a little disappointed seeing the tiny little weenie that they skewed up. It was still a similar flavor profile, but not the same for me.We ordered a couple of the caipirinhas too - I had the hibiscus which was very nice and fresh. Finished our meal with their seasonal watermelon with tajin. I honestly expected it to be a drink so imagine my surprise when they brought out actual watermelon.Service was a little slow and the meal was definitely more expensive than it had any right to be, but I'm definitely looking forward to coming back and trying the picanha or the coxinhas","1966 Hillhurst Ave Los Angeles, CA 90027",4.4,50,"Brazilian, Cocktail Bars",

239,2023-09-02,2023-09-17,Bang Bang Noodles,"We came on a Friday night, and luckily we found parking nearby. Once we went inside Citizen Public Market, we found Bang Bang Noodles hidden, in the middle of the hustle and bustle of this lively Culver City hotspot.  This is a great place to see first hand that food could bring random and all kinds of personalties together . The vibes in this part of town are very welcoming.Tingling Cumin Noodle Dry with beef $16: I think this is good if you really like cumin. It was heavy on the cumin, and we didn't finish it all. Because it wasn't being eaten quickly, the noodles stuck together and became clumps.Tomato Dry Noodle with beef $16: This dish was more tasty and had different flavors. I like the taste break with having the texture of veggies and meat in the dish.Overall, I liked the Tomato Dry Noodle, and eat it quickly!Warning:  There aren't many comfortable seats to sit on and seemed like everyone was in a hurry.After eating our dinner, we walked across the street to Salt and Straw. We enjoyed a relaxing Friday night eating our ice cream  on the Culver steps.","9355 Culver Blvd Ste J Culver City, CA 90232",3.8,400,"Noodles, Pop-Up Restaurants",$$
239,2023-09-01,2023-09-17,Bang Bang Noodles,"Saw this place on TV, so while in LA decided to give it a try. I was sorely disappointed with the taste of the sauce they used on the noodles. I tried the dry noodles and ordered two different styles and both were unappetizing. Sorry, but I can't recommend this place. We asked for a refund which they agreed to issue for one of our dishes, however, it never appeared on my credit card statement. Not very nice!","9355 Culver Blvd Ste J Culver City, CA 90232",3.8,400,"Noodles, Pop-Up Restaurants",$$
239,2023-08-27,2023-09-17,Bang Bang Noodles,"""Why do they call it Bang Bang"" -- I asked myself. Before getting blown away watching the chef pull the noodles and slap them down onto the counter as they elongate the dough. ""OH, IT GOES BANG BANG""I smiled and tried noodles in both soup and without soup. Pros and cons to either option, but I believe I prefer the soup-less version more. I really do like the Szechuan flavors throughout the noodles.","9355 Culver Blvd Ste J Culver City, CA 90232",3.8,400,"Noodles, Pop-Up Restaurants",$$
239,2023-08-26,2023-09-17,Bang Bang Noodles,"This bowl of noodles packed so much flavor and spice and messy goodness that I just knew I was going to get some on me.  And I did, but so damn worth it!  Explosion after explosion of spicy goodness each time the chop sticks carried this goodness to my mouth!  I didn't have any water and needed some but each time I gathered my composure to leave the table to get some water I found my self with my chopsticks back in my hand and shoveling more of these amazing, velvety noodles into my salivating mouth.We also tried the same thing but in a soup format, also damn tasty! Everything was right with these dishes. If I had to complain about anything at all, it would be that they gave us three napkins for four people eating these dishes.  I need at least three for myself, don't ask.Greta food and great ambiance sitting in the Citizen Market.","9355 Culver Blvd Ste J Culver City, CA 90232",3.8,400,"Noodles, Pop-Up Restaurants",$$

We tried the Dry Szechuan Garlic Noodles and Tingling Cumin Noodle Soup, which were both boasting delicious flavor. Don't forget to add the beef shank, which was well-cooked and tender.Full review and video on my Instagram @see_lim:instagram.com/reel/Cpe5j…","9355 Culver Blvd Ste J Culver City, CA 90232",3.8,400,"Noodles, Pop-Up Restaurants",$$

240,2023-08-26,2023-09-17,Love Hour,"I am baffled how this place has 5 stars. These people must be getting paid to leave these reviews. It isn't even comparable to the other smash burger spots in LA. The lack of customers was alarming -- my partner and I were the only ones rheee eating. There were two people at the bar drinking. If it's so amazing you think there would be customers?The burger meat was plain and the meat was of poor quality. And the patties were basically a glob of meat in the middle. Hugely chopped raw WHITE onions? Should be sautéed sweet onions. C'mon! The pickles were terrible. They were bitter and they don't use pickling cucumbers, just the regular with tough skins. Yuck! The love sauce was by far the worst tasting burger sauce I've ever had. The flavors were so off. And the ranch was just as bad. And they charge 75 cents for the tiniest cup of sauce and fill it halfway. Complete rip-off. Chris N Eddy's gives out unlimited sauces and their food is 10 million X better and half the price.The fries were decent and the onions rings were okay but way too much breading per onion and they were burnt.Needless to say, if you think this is the best smash burger in LA you clearly have not tried their competitors!","532 S Western Ave Los Angeles, CA 90020",4.8,56,"Burgers, Food Stands, Bars",$$
240,2023-08-14,2023-09-17,Love Hour,Been on a hunt for the best smash burger in LA - I actually got to try love hour at Coachella this past year. It was worth the wait at Coachella so I wanted to take my boyfriend to try it.We ordered two double burgers with a side of cheese fries. The patty had the crispiest meat skirt and seasoned perfectly! What I like is that there is a bar next door so you can order a beer while you wait.

240,2023-08-05,2023-09-17,Love Hour,This is a really cool spot that gets lit and good vibes on certain nights where DJ's play music and there are other events. It is located in Ktown. Their smash burgers are mayo based and really good. The servers are always chill and friendly.

240,2023-07-11,2023-09-17,Love Hour,"this was one of, if not the best, burgers i've had! a delicious burger doesn't need a hundred toppings --  just the best quality patty, a fresh, soft bun and maybe some ketchup and mustard or homemade sauce and you're set. i had two burgers the day i first tried them, with a side of onion rings and HOMEMADE pickles. def on my top favs list!","532 S Western Ave Los Angeles, CA 90020",4.8,56,"Burgers, Food Stands, Bars",$$

Chillest, most attentive staff I've encountered in a good min!BEST BURGERS EVER? Yes. Don't question my taste in burgers.Speaking of chill, as a native Los Angeleno, I'm used to mini &/or mega heatwaves; I went to Love Hour after work for a 'double' & was legit impressed with how cool it was while I was there, both metaphorically & literally. Shout out to their air conditioning that helped me cool down while I watched Game 2. We're just going to ignore the fact that the Lakers lost the game.Parking is tedious, it's Ktown, stop acting shocked, ya'll.Menu is impressive, lots of drink options, especially if you're into beer!I'm a firm believer in getting what you pay for. $10+ for a burger might be a bit much for some, but the quality, ambiance, & space to hang with friends - & even make a few more while there! - is well worth the price.","532 S Western Ave Los Angeles, CA 90020",4.8,56,"Burgers, Food Stands, Bars",$$
240,2023-05-11,2023-09-17,Love Hour,This easily became my new favorite burger joint in the neighborhood. The potato bun was perfect and the pickles taste like they are made in house. The chicken nuggets remind me of McDonald's but more flavorful and juicy. The fries were perfect! I love that you can add different flavors to the fries. Their love sauce is so good! It's like a honey mustard style sauce. I wish they were open a little later but I do love that they have a little bar in the back. The served natural wine and beer. They were also playing the playoff NBA games which is a nice perk. The bartender was super sweet and let me try different wines before I made my choice. All of the wines that I tasted were really good and it was hard to make a decision. I can totally see myself becoming a regular here! I'm so happy to stumble upon this place!,"532 S Western Ave Los Angeles, CA 90020",4.8,56,"Burgers, Food Stands, Bars",$$
