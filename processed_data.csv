1,2023-09-16,2023-09-17,GRANVILLE,"great ambiance indoors and attentive staff. really great food. right next to cedars so lots of ambulance sirens, so eat inside if that bothers you. be careful with the margarita. they must put ghost chili peppers in it because i couldn't feel my lips after one sip. had to ditch it. but the stroganoff and brownie dessert were terrific.","8701 Beverly Blvd West Hollywood, CA 90048",4.4,2672,"American (New), Cocktail Bars",0.6000000000000002

1,2023-09-03,2023-09-17,GRANVILLE,"visited granville for a quick lunch and had an excellent experience. we were seated immediately, which was a nice surprise.started off with the brussel sprouts and bread and butter--both were delicious and set a high expectation for the rest of the meal. for entrees, i had the el gaucho salad with chicken, and my partner opted for the angel hair pasta. both were satisfying and flavorful.we were so eager to dig in that we forgot to take photos, so i guess we'll just have to come back for round two! overall, a solid four-star experience.","8701 Beverly Blvd West Hollywood, CA 90048",4.4,2672,"American (New), Cocktail Bars",0.6000000000000002

1,2023-08-31,2023-09-17,GRANVILLE,"the food was fine and the ambiance was nice. our server was the bartender and he was kind enough but a bit too busy to focus on our refills and checking in.i ordered the salad with add on veggie chicken. it came out to $23, which i would call very over priced for the portion size. the taste was good but it was a small salad and the $6 add on protein was super bland without much thought given to its preparation.my husband got the caesar salad with an $8 salmon add on. he enjoyed it but, again, it was small.i don't think our waters were ever refilled.i can understand being busy but i probably wouldn't revisit simply because of the unwarranted high prices.","8701 Beverly Blvd West Hollywood, CA 90048",4.4,2672,"American (New), Cocktail Bars",0.6000000000000002
2,2023-09-16,2023-09-17,Running Goose,"visited this restaurant based off of a recommendation on instagram, and needless to say had a very mixed experience.first, the service was very good. the staff was very nice and helpful when describing the menu and some of the more popular items.secondly, the food was delicious. my friends and i each enjoyed our plates as we ordered everything from the calamari to the chilaquiles and steak. the short rib in the chilaquiles was super tender and flavorful and i could've eaten bowls of it the remainder of the day.the biggest issue we had while dining was simply the flies that were around due to a lot of the live plants from the environment of the restaurant. so that was a bit of a nuisance when dining and trying to fight off the gnats a little bit during the earlier hours of brunch.unsure if that's a normal experience, but aside from that definitely recommend the cuisine here.","1620 N Cahuenga Blvd Los Angeles, CA 90028",4.3,1701,"Gastropubs, Latin American",0.5333333333333332
2,2023-09-16,2023-09-17,Running Goose,"came here before pantages and what a unique find. you can tell the chef trying to be unique and trying to do things just a bit different. the warmth and hospitality were wonderful. we ordered a variety of dishes including arugala tostada (tasted like a delicious avocado toast), corn tostada (ok), potatoes (yummy but could be crispier), pork belly (deliciously charred), beet quesadilla (wow...who would have guessed), baked brie (oh my!), and the crème brûlée (very good). the only thing that disappointed me was the pavlova. one of my ultimate favorite desserts. i loved the effort to be unique. it was a deconstructed pavlova with ice cream. it seemed to be more ice cream than anything and the fruit was very tart. so one bite was super sweet and the next was so tart my mouth and face literally puckered. the back patio was quaint and a fun find tucked in hollywood. the owner was super sweet making sure everything was ok, telling us to walk to pantages bc parking was cheaper. this felt much more like a european cafe where you asked for a check and you can sit and talk to friends all night. or even going over to his house for a bbq. we weren't rushed in anyway. would recommend trying.","1620 N Cahuenga Blvd Los Angeles, CA 90028",4.3,1701,"Gastropubs, Latin American",0.5333333333333332

2,2023-09-10,2023-09-17,Running Goose,"i can't say anything about the food because unfortunately, i didn't make it that far. we came in on a hot summer day and asked the owner/waiter if there was a fan or somewhere with a/c. his reaction was rude, apathetic, and snobby. if he would've answered empathetically we probably would have stayed, but the attitude definitely made us loose our appetite. i felt like he was doing a favor letting us sit at his restaurant. everyone in the restaurant looked like they were sitting in a sauna. for a nice expensive meal, i don't want to drip all over the table and be talked down to, thank you.","1620 N Cahuenga Blvd Los Angeles, CA 90028",4.3,1701,"Gastropubs, Latin American",0.5333333333333332
2,2023-09-05,2023-09-17,Running Goose,"phenomenal. came for brunch and all the food was amazing. the benedict comes with ham not sliced ham, chunks of ham. i thought it was actually pork belly. so, so good. the brioche toast was like a dessert. the house-made lemonade is perfect: fresh lemon flavor and not too sweet. service was great, and the outdoor seating area is great. if it were a hotter day, i could see it getting uncomfortably hot on the patio, and they could use some fans out there. highly recommend for brunch!","1620 N Cahuenga Blvd Los Angeles, CA 90028",4.3,1701,"Gastropubs, Latin American",0.5333333333333332

2,2023-09-02,2023-09-17,Running Goose,"wow!!!! the food is unique and delicious!!!! i went with my niece, we were both hungry, and ordered 2 corn tortillas, lamb chops, the farmers vegetable which was fried carrots and short ribs. every single dish was extraordinary in taste and texture. the best meal i can remember in a very long time, so different in taste. we were full and didn't have room for dessert, which also looked scrumptious!!!my only critique would be better curb appeal. when we walked in i thought maybe i'd made a mistake as the ambiance was lacking but the friendly staff and incredible food made that all a minor foot note. it wouldn't be costly to create an other worldly ambiance. just some faux leaf trellis panels attached to the wooden 1/2 walls that are throughout and maybe some big ceramic pots and some kind of creative hanging animal art descending from the ceiling. like hanging globe or wild birds from the ceiling. there's such a diverse culinary experience that creating an atmosphere that draws us in would make it all the more stellar. but stellar running goose is!!!!","1620 N Cahuenga Blvd Los Angeles, CA 90028",4.3,1701,"Gastropubs, Latin American",0.5333333333333332

17,2023-08-14,2023-09-17,Osteria Mamma,"this is hands down one of the best italian restaurants in los angeles. i have been dining here for 15 years now. the decor is simple and understated with generational photos of the family that run the restaurant. ask your server to point out who is who and hear the history of this incredible, hard working family. chances are the young ones in the photos have grown up and taken a role in the operation of this family gem.on to the food...the menu has grown over the years adding dishes that are a bit more contemporary while also keeping the original items too. for starters they recently added an arancini dish loaded with saffron infused arborio rice and short rib. it is super crispy on the outside and beautifully decadent on the inside. the dish is accompanied by three incredible sauces to soak up. additionally i have always loved their frittura mista and the polipozzo to start with. the salads are beautiful and fresh and delicious.the pasta is on another level here. all of these dishes will make you feel like the namesake momma still prepares them herself, may she rip. my favorite is the tonnarelli alla carbonara, the sauce is thick and creamy yet delicate and the guanciale is cooked to a crispness that just makes it pop in your mouth. another favorite is the bigolo all'amatriciana, the pasta is thick and filled with a beautiful texture and the guanciale is mouth watering in the san marzano tomatoes it is cooked down with.for mains we have always enjoyed the bisteconna and the il branza, both of which always come out perfectly cooked and leaving us wanting more, which is hard because these dishes are large and worth sharing.now i am no wine aficionado, however the wine menu is incredible. they feature mainly italian wines with a book that gives the region the grapes were grown and define's each areas practices and tastes. it's a history lesson of wine really. do not let this intimidate you. the servers know each wine almost by heart and can tell you, based on your likes or dislikes, which will best suit you. they are currently offering a $20 wine flight that is unbeatable. do not pass on it!i truly love this place so much and am so happy this family has kept their momma's traditions alive. it brings me so much happiness just stepping into this place.","5732 Melrose Ave Los Angeles, CA 90038",4.0,1916,"Italian, Wine Bars",0.3333333333333333

26,2023-08-31,2023-09-17,Juliana Los Angeles,"my friends and i really wanted to like this place and support a fellow korean american new business, so it saddens me to have to write this review.as some other 1 star reviews have mentioned, i was very surprised to see so many 5 star reviews of this establishment - take a deep breath because this is gonna be a long one.we made reservations for 6:45pm for a party of four. host was friendly when we entered and upon telling her we had reservations she told us it was open seating and to sit wherever we like. they don't have standard tables, it is a ""lounge concept"" (their words not mine) with one long communal table in the middle and then a bunch of small round tables along each side of the walls. what was strange was as we were waiting for our order i saw the servers putting out 'reserve' signs and arranging tables - did our reservation not fall under that category?interior is cute, very instagrammable. dinnerware seemed very cheap. this place hasn't even been open for very long and the paint coating on the silverware was already 80% chipped off, which also made it look dirty. glassware was sticky.we were excited to try all the food so here's what we ordered:green tangerine ade (-10/10): no flavor. glass it was served in was extremely sticky all around the outside.truffle fries (-10/10): the most generic brand of frozen fries. pale, soggy, limp - not crispy at all. fried in a gang of oil and then tossed lightly in some truffle oil. no aioli, served with ketchup on the saddest looking plate. this was our bad, should've expected something like this for $6.ceviche (1/10): served in a martini cup, which did not look food safe with 5 christmas tortilla chips. what we ordered did not look like the photo posted on yelp at all. we received less than 1/4 cup of ceviche. only redeeming quality was the lemon was good.prosciutto bruschetta (-10/10): this should not even be called bruschetta. bruschetta usually consists of grilled bread rubbed with garlic, topped with tomatoes, olive oil, etc. what we got was 2 tiny thick a** pieces of stale bread topped with the biggest mountains of ricotta cheese and two halves of a cherry tomato on top. no seasoning, ricotta tasted sour.grilled pulpo (3/10): this only gets a 3 because it was cooked very well, the octopus was tender, but the seasoning tasted like kids applesauce (very sweet) and there was no chimichurri sauce as shown in the photos.at this point we asked our server if it was possible to cancel the rest of our order because we were so disappointed with everything that came out so far. the gentleman came back to tell us it was too late, end of story. it would have been nice if he asked what was wrong with the food or if there was something they could do to remedy the situation.herb crisped lamb chop (0/10): 0 because we never received it. actually kind of glad this one didn't come out because all the food we had tasted so far was not good.tenderloin (3/10): this also gets a 3 because the cook on the steak was tender. definitely not worth $35. the steak also had an extremely sweet seasoning that tasted like fruit rollups to me. strange. the same server we asked to cancel our order with brought out this dish and he just seemed over it b/c we had previously asked if it was possible to cancel. the dish comes out with a dome lid with smoke inside - there was no presentation of the food, he dropped the plate on the table, took the lid off and walked away lol. no description of the steak seasoning on the menu.lobster risotto (-10/10): the absolute worst. when the server brought this out i thought it was a korean pancake. it was drowning in a soup of ""gambas"" oil (also not mentioned on the menu) and was so overcooked it was basically a porridge. lobster was undercooked and tasted like it had gone bad.my friends and i will normally finish as much as we can because what a waste of food! we're also not the pickiest eaters and are not that hard to please. however, these dishes were quite inedible so we asked for our check. there was another female server who came over with our bill and when we were explaining why we were leaving she was very apologetic, which is why i'm giving a 3 for service. the other dude should not be working in the service industry. a manager or server did not come over once during our stay to ask how things were or to ask if there was anything they could do to improve our experience. i have worked in many restaurants and typically if a customer is that dissatisfied with the food, the restaurant will comp some items. we actually had to remind them to remove the lamp chops from our bill b/c we never received it. we paid the entire bill + tip and as soon as we got up to leave we could see all the servers swarming to our table to clean it up and it seemed like they were badmouthing us. not a good look, they could've at least waited until we were out of sight hahaha.avoid. avoid. avoid.","3500 W 6th St Los Angeles, CA 90020",4.2,69,"Breakfast & Brunch, Lounges, Tapas/Small Plates",0.4666666666666668

59,2023-09-16,2023-09-17,Perch,"perch is an la staple: the type of place that is consistently cited as a destination for tourists, the glitter-on-cheek crowd, instagram influencers, those trying to land the gig, and those who want to experience the promise of perch and determine for themselves if perch merits its august reputation. i fall into the last category, and i can say that perch fulfills its promise, kind-of, but not really, but at the same time it kind of does, if that makes sense. like imagine that you have been wanting to taste this cookie and finally you do, and the cookie is everything you hoped it would be but not in the way you expected it to be. so you build up expectations in your head, that the reality of the situation does not deliver. i guess that is the problem with having a robust and notable reputation, you could never live up to it because you can never measure up to a person's imagination.my partner in dine was my friend carlos, the epitome of a peter pan type, old enough to know better, but stubborn enough to remain young at heart. he credits his youthful charm, perspective, and look to his regular visits to the gym and eating right. note that he did not order the fruit plate of perch, which means that he is not too strict.i opt for valet. it cost 16.00 dollars. if it it seems high, it is not for downtown la prices. when we got close, the valet asked if i could park a car in a nearby spot. i sternly, said no, ""you can park it."" i did feel a certain type of way for being asked to park my own car, even if the spot was close. i go out to be pampered, to be a princess in the world of dining, and quite frankly, a princess does not park her own carriage. carlos made a joke to the valet, on how i needed my car parked because i did not know how to park that well. i was annoyed. i stood up for myself, and for that i was the butt of a joke. i paid 16 dollars, i did not want to park my car. am i right reader? or am i wrong? truthfully there is no right or wrong answer. i told carlos how i felt and it took a cocktail from perch to my mellow my nerves.the cocktails were not only effective, but tasty. i am someone who does not like to taste alcohol. i informed our server of this fact. i cannot remember their name but they read female to me, so i will be using she/her pronouns to refer to them. i asked our server what recommendation she had for a super sweet drink, she suggested a drink, i cannot remember what it was called but it was pink- fruity for sure, and it had a rim of brown sugar, maybe. it went down sweet-- just like i like my cocktails. this was the cocktail that softened my nerves enough to forget carlo's blunder of joking with the valet at my expense.carlos and i started off with the avocado toast. it was solid. i especially appreciated the citrus taste afloat the avocado toast. i also appreciated that the toast was sliced into three slices. i hate when i have to wrestle with my avocado toast; either while cutting it, or when picking it up. i also appreciated that carlos did not wrestle me when i had two of the slices, and he only 1. still that did not atone for his faux pa.the rest of the food was simply solid. i had the burger, and the potatoes. he had the classic breakfast: two eggs, chic ken sausage, and potatoes. he cleaned his plate, he left a small bite of the sausage. i had that small piece before it was taken away by the server. glad i did--- it was really good sausage!there was a bus-person, she read female to me. she preferred to speak spanish to me. she had a necklace that was half a heart and half an infinity sign. i asked her, who gave her the lovely gift. she replied her husband with a smile that my heart saw. we shared a moment. she felt it too.as she was cleaning tables, our eyes met and she returned a sincere smile. when i left the joint to go to the perch bar, she said in spanish, thank you for coming, in the most sincere way, like a mother's kiss on her child's cheek- pure love. this is the type of service i expect, customer-centered, sincere, and like i was welcomed guest. now you see, why i ddid not park my car myself, because that made me feel like i was a number to be processed, and i needed to help in the processing progress of my own turn around the revolving door.of course, perch is nestled in the heart of la. you sit amidst la's famous skyline. that is why for those who want pictures, go here. our dining neighbors did. it was two women and one got up three times to take pictures of her partner in dine. then the server tried her hand at the picture taking. the women did not come together for the server. the same woman who was photographed by her partner in dine, was now being photographed by the server. so, i get that good pictures are important for people, so if pictures are that important for you, come here. but i guess everyone needs to go to perch to experience its promise and decide for yourself if it was fulfilled or not. its lofty reputation demands it!","448 S Hill St Los Angeles, CA 90013",4.1,10020,"Lounges, French, Breakfast & Brunch",0.39999999999999974

(or, well, someplace other than the block of west adams that it shares with an auto repair shop.)the service is exceptional. attentive but not intrusive, with lots of lovely little touches, like storing your leftovers in their refrigerator until you're ready to leave.the cocktail menu is small and creative. i tried the espresso & date martini, with vodka, oat milk, aquafaba and orange, and it was superb--well-balanced and very unique. i also tried a sip (and then possibly three more sips when someone wasn't looking...) of the fig & walnut (with scotch, sweet vermouth and apricot) and it was excellent. i'm excited to return and try the other four cocktails on the menu.cento's menu is pretty seafood-heavy, so as someone who can't eat seafood, i worried that i wouldn't find much to eat. but in fact, i found too much to eat. (see the note about leftovers above.)we started with the heirloom radicchio salad--with dates, pecan, and raspberry vinaigrette--and the presentation was astoundingly beautiful. it tasted even better. next up was the farro salad with roasted eggplant (that's blended into a sort of baba ghanoush and mixed into the salad), dill crème fraiche and pomegranate, and that was amazing, too. it looked very simple, but the flavors were astounding. i could eat vats of it.then, it was time for pasta (!!!). we ordered three pastas for the two of us, because we simply couldn't decide (again, reference note about leftovers...). the bolognese was my favorite--a super comforting dish of ricotta gnocchi in a phenomenal meat sauce. i also loved the sweet corn agnolotti (charred corn, crème fraiche, old bay and chervil). definitely don't miss that one. and finally, the spicy pomodoro (which was not very spicy at all, and i'm a spice wimp), because i saw it going to several other tables and had to try it. while it was my least favorite of the three, it was still great.and finally...dessert. do. not. miss. dessert. the banana pudding tiramisu (a combination of things i wouldn't normally be into) was one of the best desserts i've ever had in life. it's their specialty. just do it.","4921 W Adams Blvd Los Angeles, CA 90016",4.5,631,"Italian, Mediterranean, Tapas/Small Plates",0.6666666666666666

82,2023-09-11,2023-09-17,Providence,i was extremely impressed with providence from start to finish. the entire dining experience was everything i expected and hoped it would be. right when you enter you're greeted and they ask for your valet ticket number so your car will be pulled up right when your dinner is done. i genuinely appreciate those extra little fine touches.in total we had 11 courses and i did the additional wine pairing with the meal. i truly enjoyed each course and it felt like a work of art. the wine pairings went well with with each course. some courses were better than others but all in all i loved the take on each one. the service was impeccable and i really liked the ambiance of the restaurant. i also appreciate they time your courses based on your dining and how quickly you eat.,"5955 Melrose Ave Los Angeles, CA 90038",4.4,2942,"American (New), Seafood",0.6000000000000002

82,2023-09-08,2023-09-17,Providence,"if you're reading this review one of your main questions is: is it worth it? first, each meal is about $300. the wine pairing is about $150. then, there are the upgrades. tax. and tip. so if you do the simple addition you can see you'll spend a lot of money on your meal. so is it worth it? well, let me say it is by far the most i have ever spent on one meal. by far! so go in with your eyes open. but was it worth it? unequivocally yes! it's not just the food it's the experience. if you watch the bear you know that restaurants like providence seek to give you a full experience because they know you're spending a lot of money. the food alone was excellent. starting with the amuse bouche which was so good i didn't know how they would top it. but they did. each course explained. the servers seamlessly tagged teamed our dining experience. i don't drink so while my wife had her wine pairings they were kind enough to set up mocktail pairings for me, which i don't think they'd done before. there were certain food i didn't care for. i went with most of it but they were really clear that they want you to so speak up and ask for what you need and want. (but don't be a d$@& about it ) as one of our servers said, ""here, we want you to say something. always say something. it is not your job to fit into our experience. it is our job to fit into your experience."" as someone who has been called high maintenance that was honestly really nice to hear. everything was good. you get to take your time enjoying the meal and enjoying your company. it was our twenty year anniversary and it was a great way to begin to celebrate it! and here is the cherry on top: i forgot my business card there. at first they couldn't find it but sarah looked a second time after we looked everywhere and she found it tucked into the bottom of the bill holder. that alone was above and beyond. but then they did not simply say come get when you can they asked where i lived and checked to see if someone might be able to drop it off! drop it off at my house. are you kidding me? well, they did. it would have been a two hour trip with traffic for me to get it and i was leaving for business the next day. who does that? providence does. so if you want to have a special experience with amazing food and are willing to invest in it i highly recommend giving yourself the gift of providence, at least once.","5955 Melrose Ave Los Angeles, CA 90038",4.4,2942,"American (New), Seafood",0.6000000000000002
82,2023-09-01,2023-09-17,Providence,"providence was a very solid dinner experience with friendly and knowledgeable servers. the restaurant is fairly dark inside but each table has its own lamp, which adds a very intimate vibe. we found free street parking near the dmv about a block away but there is valet parking available too.we started the meal with two cocktails. i forgot what they were, but one had watermelon and the other had honey from the beehive on the second floor. both were good and not too sweet. from the add-ons, we got uni egg with caviar which was a bit salty (most likely due to the caviar) but delicious, along with the rabbit tortellini which was good but could use some more flavor.for the main dinner menu, the amuse bouche was a great start with shiso wrapped tuna and several other small bites. we both loved the shima aji, but everything else lacked a similar wow factor. however, we both did not like the bread service. compared to some other fine dining restaurants, the crust here was very hard to chew and might poke the inside of your mouth if you try to bite off the corner so be wary of that.we got the swordfish and the duck for the entrees. the swordfish was soft but didn't have a whole lot of flavor, but this was also my first time eating swordfish so i don't have anything to compare it with. however, we've eaten duck multiple times and the one here was good but not great. it was cooked well but the sauce could also use more flavor and salt.onto dessert, the mango one was like a sorbet and tasted really good. very fresh and flavorful mango. the chocolate dessert tasted somewhat like haagan daz which is a good thing, but needed more of the ice cream to balance out the chocolate. then finally, there were a couple small bites and sweet coffee to end the night.","5955 Melrose Ave Los Angeles, CA 90038",4.4,2942,"American (New), Seafood",0.6000000000000002

86,2023-08-20,2023-09-17,Ubuntu,"tried ubuntu in a group of 4 for a celebratory dinner and had a wonderful experience. we all left full and happy, will definitely be coming back!the food is meant to be shared family style with a recommendation of 2-3 plates per person. we ordered one of each food menu item and our favorites were:- jollof arancini - well-seasoned, perfectly fried and the sauce on top was so delicious, we got a second order- grilled cabbage - smoky, savory- fonio grits - love they use old bay with mushrooms- palm bisque - it's got some great heat- lion's mane pie - perfect crust and yummy fillingwe also enjoyed all the other dishes, the only one that was a miss was the suya. i love celery root and was looking forward to this dish. unfortunately it didn't come together for any of us. the celery root was grilled perfectly but wasn't seasoned enough, the tzatziki seemed like an after thought - not much of it and also wasn't well seasoned - and we didn't get where the tomato confit was (ours was served with fresh micro greens, red onion and tomato). great concept, i hope they work out the execution of it bc i'd love to try an improved version of this dish.both desserts were delicious. the plantain cardamom tart was served warm and gobbled up quickly. the puff puffs were fried to perfection but the chutney was a tad savory for a dessert course, and that generally seemed to be the consensus - we left a bunch on the plate.not taking a star off for any of the slight misses, bc we had a great experience overall.they have a full service bar with wine, beer, and a great cocktail and mocktail menu. we each got a cocktail or mocktail and it's so nice to have a yummy grown up drink for anyone who doesn't want to drink for personal reasons. i got the viridescence and would recommend as a light summer refresher :)the decor is beautiful with trees and overhead lights on the patio, and inside fiddle leaf figs, plush banquets, etc. a nice place to dress up a bit and go have fun.the service was warm and attentive from upon arrival until we left. several of us were running a few minutes late, they didn't guilt trip us and sat us as we arrived, ensuring each person got water and drink orders started. they were kind and attentive throughout and showed genuine appreciation for our patronage. they even initiated an offer to take a group photo for us which we appreciated!parking was easy - my partner and i found street parking on melrose, our friends got valet ($10). again, they don't make you wait for the whole group to arrive to seat you, so you can have someone look for parking while others get seated and order drinks if you prefer to save on valet.","7469 Melrose Ave Los Angeles, CA 90046",4.7,9,"Vegan, African",0.8000000000000002
86,2023-08-13,2023-09-17,Ubuntu,"overall, ambience was super cute. we loved the customer service and most dishes were tasty. but one issue i would say that came from our visit tonight was food portion. we ordered 6 dishes for the night. now i get that this is a more upscale restaurant but the portion size was extremely small. so if you come know you probably won't get full. the entrees are the size of appetizers. it felt like everything was tapas basically. i was really taken a back by the grits dish. considering this is usually a hearty dish, i was thrown off by what we received. it looked like we had a scoop of grits smushed down to the shape of the bowl they came in with a few mushrooms and raw tomatoes with a bit of a sauce. considering that grits are such a cheap dish, one would at least think that you'd have enough to share with the table. the rice and black eye peas portion also very small to share. lastly, we loved the lions mane pie. but when you realize you paid $14 for a small one it makes you question what you're doing. the jollof arancini was tasty very diff than jollof but was really good. my friends ordered the non-alcoholic hibiscus drink. they loved it. mine i ordered the gin drink called nyaniba but it tasted like it was also non-alcoholic. was tasty if it were a drink without alcohol. if you have money to burn to taste appetizers i'd say this is def a cool spot to try but honestly if you thought you were going to get more of the filling west african food with a vegan spin, you're not going to get that here.","7469 Melrose Ave Los Angeles, CA 90046",4.7,9,"Vegan, African",0.8000000000000002

(foodies know what i'm talking about) being portuguese, we're very critical about pasta and sauce and what is ""wipe the plate clean status"".the bread comes with a butter and sauce on top of the butter. texture, taste and presentation made this place i'd have special occasions at for sure.the only two things that were disappointing is parking and the bathroom. parking does not exist and is on a very busy street. your only options are valet at currently $10 or park a distance and walk there.the bathroom is a unisex bathroom with three sinks located to the left, 3 stalls and one bathroom at the end with a men's urinal. twice i had to use the restroom and the seat of the toilet was up. no big deal but something i'd like to avoid having to deal with.overall great place. hope to see the meatball appetizer be a main dish with pasta and will definitely come back day one it hits the menu.note: didn't post pictures of the food because the pics already on here match what i'm saying. plus i have to leave a little to your own imagination.","11720 Ventura Blvd Studio City, CA 91604",3.9,3137,"American (New), Lounges, Cocktail Bars",0.2666666666666666

120,2023-08-21,2023-09-17,Mr. T,"i came back from a work trip and thought driving up from san diego to la on a friday night was worth a bit of a splurge for dinner. mr. t was near my place and i had it down as a 'one day soon,' place, somewhere that needed a bit of an occasion to go to and not just a regular place. the minimalist interior, the neon sign it definitely didn't have that 'tuesday night dinner' kind of vibe.i gambled that it wouldn't be packed on a friday night and while it was busy it was very easy to get a table on their patio which was open enough to be mellow but seemed to magically block out the cement plant across the street.i wasn't driving so when the server came by i ordered their twist on an old fashioned, the double up. i've decried a 20 dollar cocktail before and i will again here-but it was tasty, that can't be denied. i think fat-washed spirits are a bit much, or i did until here, it wasn't just the flavor but the heft of it. the coconut oil was a better call then say bacon fat, which i think leaves too much residue. look, it's 20 bucks, i still think it's a bit overpriced but i'd get it again while grumbling that it might be 2 bucks more than it should.what i'm definitely more comfortable splurging on are appetizers/small plates/shareables so the lamb kebab, chip n' dip and the croquettes were all ordered and devoured. the kebab was delicious with the lamb being right at the edge of tender/game-y. the chip and dip was like an upscale version of a basic starter but not overly so, a little tartness, a little savory. perfect. the croquettes though, all veg, but still so rich.i figured if they could do chips and dip up why not have their burger. i have a clip of the flambe which was a nice touch but without the theatrics it was still a very well-done burger with a bonus of char and that spicy aioli that came with the fries.our server was so great that it didn't take much convincing to get their desserts which also seemed really simply but done well. all in all it's a great place to go to, make up an occasion, just go.","953 N Sycamore Ave Los Angeles, CA 90038",4.5,97,French,0.6666666666666666

(around 9pm ish). there were so many empty tables.as soon as we entered, we asked for a table for 6 people to this server lady and she said we should take the table where only 4 people can fit in.so we asked her if we can sit at the bigger table since it was too small, she said no and this table for 4 would fit perfectly for 6 (it was not at all!!! and there were only 4 chairs with no more space to place more chairs)the smaller table that she wanted us to sit was at the corner of the restaurant which was closer for her to serve (seemed like she didn't really want to move that much and if we had the bigger table, she needed to walk more i guess/ other customers were sitting at the same row) so we appealed again if it would be okay to sit at the longer table which about 8 people can fit and she had those rolling eyes and said ""yeah- you can sit over there if you want to"" with sarcastic voice and face.seriously? it only seemed like she was too lazy to serve. if those bigger tables were reserved or there was a wait behind us, we would have understood, but in this situation, her laziness is the only explanation.everyone in my group got so offended so we decided to leave. thank you lady! because of your attitude, we don't want to here never ever again!!!","3601 W 6th St Los Angeles, CA 90020",4.2,45,Korean,0.4666666666666668

125,2023-09-14,2023-09-17,Home Restaurant - Los Feliz,"tldr: 2 stars for service; 4 stars for foodthis 3 star review is targeted at their bar set up. dropped by for brunch on labor day weekend around 11am for a party of two. parking is strictly street parking in the area so give yourself time to circle around the neighborhood. as i put my name down on the list and was quoted ~30 min wait i was also advised that the bar area was open with no wait. my friend and i walked into the bar and saw some high top tables open. we sat on one after confirming with a waiter walking by that those too were considered the ""bar area"". we could see the bartenders making drinks and assumed we would be given menus shortly.about 10 mins passed and nobody had approached us. behind us was another couple and we leaned over and asked if they had ordered at the bar since they had menus and we weren't sure if that was the expectation. they told us they had been waiting for 20 mins and nobody had come up to them either. they were given menus when they first sat down and told someone would come up to them. they had even walked up to the bar and asked if they needed to put their order there and they were told that again someone would come up to them.that nice couple offered their menus and all four of us continued to wait. at this point it's been 20 mins for us and probably 30 mins for them and despite waiters walking back and forth nobody stopped to check in on us. at this point the other couple goes up to the bar and they let them put in an order there (which if you ask me they should have let them do that when they first asked). at this point i get a text my table will be ready in 5 mins and to confirm i'm still there. the couple tells us that we should just go up to the bar and i tell them we waited long enough that our table was now ready - so much for no wait time at the bar! we left the couple inside the bar area with no food or even water offered to them!!my friend and i were taken to a table in their patio which is really cute and shaded. we ordered the french toast and the green chilaquiles with avocado and medium easy eggs to split. i also got an iced latte.the food was awesome which only makes the whole experience so disappointing. your service can really tank what was a really tasty meal. the french toast was super fluffy and not too sweet. the berries on the french toast were very fresh and the syrup was warm.the chilaquiles were incredible. i would definitely get these again - they had a nice kick and there was a perfect amount of sauce so the chips weren't soggy. my latte was also very good - it wasn't bitter.our server was very pleasant and the service once we were at the table was very fast and efficient. out the door about $50 for both of us which is a great price for food in this part of town.overall, i wouldn't recommend the bar area if it truly is always this dysfunctional. i was genuinely shocked at how horrible that whole bar experience was and i felt terrible for the other couple who didn't put their name down for a table and were just waiting for service that never came. just wait for the table if it's always this bad because the food is honestly worth it!","1760 Hillhurst Ave Los Angeles, CA 90027",4.1,3762,"Breakfast & Brunch, Coffee & Tea, American (New)",0.39999999999999974

128,2023-08-16,2023-09-17,Rich Crab,"i'm not a crab connoisseur so maybe take my review with a grain of salt. first off, i love seafood and i love to eat crab but to caveat, i've never had a general liking for the crab/shrimp heads - and eating raw crab was fairly similar to that delicacy.this was my first time eating raw crab. i wasn't sure what to expect so i came in with zero expectations, but i also walked out unsure of how i felt about the meal.i came here with a party of 4. since it was our first time, we tried the combo so that we can try both of the different flavors. we ordered a size s combo a for $119. note that the different sizes of combo refers to the stew size. everything else comes as 1 count.the service was great. food came out so fast, it literally felt like we just waited for 5 mins. as soon as it came out, we dug in. i want to say i did enjoy the soy sauce marinated crab but at the same time also wasn't sure if i liked the flavors. the spicy marinated crab was marinated very well and spicy too! loved that there was definitely a hot kick to it. you forsure need to work to eat this though and unfortunately, i'm not a huge fan of peeling crab/shrimp and really digging deep to find gold. despite all that, it tasted super fresh!the banchan was exceptionally good, and also refillable. kimchi was great but honestly felt like i got jipped. it's so thin and hardly had any kimchi pieces - it was like eating kimchi paper, not pancake. it was also smaller than what i expected. i've had better kimchi pancakes.we ordered the spicy crab stew for our stew option. spicy? no. crabby? yes. it had a very good depth of flavor in terms of crab. i wish there was more garneses/veggies but the crab pretty much filled up the pot. i didn't get to eat the crab from the pot but i was told by my boyfriend's parents that it wasn't fresh.to be completely honest, i left feeling so unsatisfied. it wasn't that i wasn't full but i think i needed something that tasted more satisfying. i think this delicacy is something everyone should try but i wouldn't consider this a meal i'd crave and want to eat for dinner. to try and experience different types of cultural food? definitely. but not something i can expect to eat every month. also, i felt it was super pricey for what it was even though i know these crabs are imported. i'd prefer to eat omakase sashimi for the price.update: after reading some reviews, i found out from other yelpers that ordering the combo, the crabs would be significantly smaller than ordering a la carte. the waitress failed to mention that to us...which now makes me realize that portioning sizes like this is incredibly unfair to the customer and super misleading. not to mention that most people who order combos expect to have a fair ratio amongst the number of people that the menu stated to feed. if your size m combo is supposed to feed 3, give more ratio of crabs rather than your stew, especially if you know people come to your restaurant to specifically try your raw crab.warning: any size combo, whether s, m, or l, all combos only comes with 1 small crab per flavor. that's bogus and definitely not worth the price. had i known, i would've just ordered a la carte. don't order the combo.","4253 W 3rd St Los Angeles, CA 90020",4.4,173,"Korean, Seafood, Soup",0.6000000000000002

155,2023-09-03,2023-09-17,Rosaline,"rosaline is fairly energy-filled two-room restaurant that generally boasts different vibes depending on whether you are dining inside or in their inside garden. i usually prefer the garden although inside you can watch the kitchen do their magic. having said that, if you join rosaline for a meal be prepared to be sitting as close t your fellow diners as you can imagine, and participate in side bar conversations around you as they get louder and louder with the drinks progressing.i love their bar but find their cocktails to be unimaginative and bland. even classic cocktails are not properly represented so i prefer to skip them.food-wise, given the peruvian theme of the restaurant there are tons of ceviches. some are nice, but the ceviche crocante for example is pretty poor and delivered like a surrealist painting where the artist dropped a bunch of ingredients otherwise intended for different appetizers on a large plate. the dressing and zest in it was also under- and over-powering at the same time. i also disliked the coquettes but mostly because of their generalized unseasonedness.the octopus - despite traditionally a favorite dish of mine, here probably wins the spot of worst-in-town. it was overcooked but not in a chewy way; rather, it was an extra dose mushy. the tentacle had similar texture to haribo gummy bears, so we left 2/3 of it.the scallops were probably the best dish of the bunch, and i thought the toasted quinoa on top with the sauce worked really well. though again as before, they were a bit overcooked as well.in the end, while i have at previous visits enjoyed the family style paella, i would probably stop going to rosaline. i had quite the underwhelming experience, service, and ended up getting a check with 20% tip automatically added, so maybe that's why service is a bit low-effort type.","8479 Melrose Ave West Hollywood, CA 90069",3.9,1131,"Peruvian, Cocktail Bars",0.2666666666666666

Restaurant,"in the ever-echoing chambers of my mind, the eternal question reverberates, ""what the hell am i in the mood for?"" as i sift through the tapestry of tastes i've encountered, the sultry allure of mexican beckons. tacos from a street vendor? the hearty embrace of a burrito? or perhaps the underrated charm of a torta? but then, a voice, dripping with sarcasm, chimes in, ""sure, but which mexico are you talking about?"" it's a gentle reminder of the vast culinary landscape of mexico, divided into seven distinct regions: norteño, bajacaliforniano, chipas, jaliscense, yucateco, veracruzano, and oaxaqueño. each with its own heartbeat, its own soul. today, my culinary compass pointed towards tlayudas - oaxaca's misunderstood masterpiece, often dubbed the ""oaxacan pizza.""tlayuda los angeles, a place where the art of tlayuda-making is revered, was my chosen sanctuary. i settled on their ""tlayuda supreme,"" a symphony of flavors on an expansive toasted corn tortilla canvas, adorned with bean puree, fresh greens, and a trinity of meats - tasajo beef, cesina pork, and the fiery chorizo.but let's get one thing straight - calling this a pizza is like calling a stradivarius a fiddle. it's closer in spirit to a tostada or an open-faced taco. the tlayuda i had was a revelation. a dish steeped in oaxacan tradition, its foundation is a tortilla, crisped to perfection. it's then painted with refried black beans, layered with greens, and crowned with oaxacan cheese and a medley of grilled meats. a splash of salsa, a sprinkle of fresh herbs, and you're on a journey. some might fold it, letting the cheese melt in a warm embrace, while others, like me, prefer it open, in all its glory. and to wash it down? a gulp of mezcal or, in my case, a refreshing mint cucumber lemonade.so, the next time the siren song of mexican food calls, ask yourself, ""which corner of mexico am i yearning for?"" today, it was oaxaqueño, with its tantalizing tlayuda. and the warmth of tlayuda los angeles? it felt like coming home to a family i never knew i had. pure magic.","5450 Santa Monica Blvd Los Angeles, CA 90029",4.6,858,Mexican,0.7333333333333331

180,2023-08-02,2023-09-17,Kazan,"what i find beautiful about japanese culture, is understanding, how gastronomy has played a major role in their rich history. let's begin by saying earning a michelin star is no ordinary occurrence. having three michelin stars makes you absolutely unique and extraordinary.you have earned the title and respect, because for you, it's about passion.you don't believe in cutting corners when it comes to the highest quality ingredients. you believe that if one must deliver the best experience and food quality it must be done right or you don't do it at all.my family and i had a wonderful experience at the museum corridor near wilshire and la brea. we used yelp to search ramen restaurants in that area and kazan populated first.noodles really didn't become a stable food in japan until the 1800s. if you truly want to taste an authentic japanese ramen house you found the place, no need to fly to tokyo anymore.oh boy, what a wonderful experience. as you can see by the photographs the restaurant is a bit small but gosh when it comes to the taste of the fresh soba thin noodles ,the distinctive flavors of the light broth, and to your tongue's desire you feel the tender texture of the chashu pork,. now, you realized you are in ramen's heaven.we ordered two signature #1 dish, and one lei ramen. absolutely, delicious. something i personally found interesting the design of the serving bowls. as you are being served you don't realized that the size portion of this soup is rather large, but it looks small.trust me it's feels you-up because the bowl has a unique design that keeps a lot of the noodles at the bottom of the bowl.the restaurant is absolutely clean, the staff were friendly and professional.last, this is a secret, if you want the best time to peacefully enjoy your meal and savor every ingredient come around 4pm. we parked at an adjacent parking structure next to the restaurant just pay the fee and relax. thanks for reading","111 N La Cienega Blvd Beverly Hills, CA 90211",4.1,330,"Noodles, Tapas/Small Plates, Ramen",0.39999999999999974

192,2023-09-12,2023-09-17,Baar Baar,"this is a good place for special occasions, it's a very beautiful space, but not necessarily a great indian food restaurant. it's aiming for an indian fine dining experience: the presentation, service, ambiance, and prices match that. however, if you just want some amazing indian food or a new spot to go when you're craving some amazing indian food, this probably isn't it. the place has good service, but it's the annoying good type (always pestering you, but on top of it) vs the predictive great service (not sure if people will get what i mean or relate). we tried several of the dishes and drinks here, see the breakdown:4/5 - baar baar butter chicken: a solid butter chicken dish with good flavors and great presentation, but very small portions with no sides of rice or anything. ($32)4/5 - paneer pinwheel: a delicious fine dining take on a classic north indian dish and a nice presentation, but same small portions as the other main dish. ($32)5/5 - mango ghewar: an amazing mango forward dessert with delicious fresh mango cubes on the inside, looks gorgeous and tastes even better, definitely the best thing on the menu! ($18)3.5/5 - ragi brownie: a really beautiful dessert that is very chocolate forward, but not super sweet. however, it's disappointing in comparison to a phenomenal dessert like the mango ghewar. ($15)4/5 - dahi puri: a solid light, but refreshing appetizer. cool presentation, perfect for two people and one of their better apps. ($14)3/5 - saffron rice: pretty standard rice side that is enough to share amongst 2 to 3 people. ($6)2/5 - cheese & jalapeno naan: pretty mediocre, even the presentation wasn't that nice, and worth it for what you get. the regular naan seems to be a better option if you're ordering naan (seems like it's a larger size, 1/2 the price, and already cut into 4 pieces as well). ($12)drinks:4.5/5 - ddlj: a great modern twist on a tequila sunrise inspiration. a good mix of tangy and lightly sour flavors. ($17)3.5/5 - rockstar: not listed on their drink menu, it's a seasonal specialty drink that features rum and is a twist on a tropical favorite.

192,2023-09-11,2023-09-17,Baar Baar,"last night, we decided to try this restaurant for dinner on a semi-whim, having made a reservation the day before. our reservation was for an early slot, so we were seated pretty promptly. the decor is really interesting - definitely different from other restaurants in the area. what really impressed me was the timing of the service - everything, from the food to the drinks, arrived swiftly but not uncomfortably fast.the dining experience here is family-style, with a recommendation to order a variety of shared plates and entrees, which are served as they are prepared. for our shared plates, we chose the dahi puri, cauliflower 65, kashmiri duck (birria) taco, and the chicken malai tikka. among these, the dahi puri and the duck taco stood out as my favorite bites of the entire meal. they were unique, refreshing, and incredibly flavorful. however, the one disappointment of the evening was the chicken malai tikka, which seemed a bit lackluster and reminded me strangely of a bland chicken alfredo.moving on to the entrees, we opted for the butter chicken, short ribs, and lamb shank roast, along with garlic naan and saffron rice. each dish was sensational in its own right, but the lamb shank roast stole the show with its tender, melt-in-your-mouth texture.as a side note, if you're in the mood for a unique and tropical-flavored cocktail, do yourself a favor and order the sholay. it'll transport you to a distant paradise and complement your meal perfectly.in summary, our impromptu visit turned out to be the perfect shared meal. with prompt service, attentive and helpful staff, a diverse array of flavorful dishes, and a standout cocktail, this restaurant is definitely worth considering for a memorable dining experience. i would just plan to skip the chicken malai tikka and savor the other delectable options they have to offer.","705 W 9th St Los Angeles, CA 90015",4.4,115,Indian,0.6000000000000002

202,2023-09-14,2023-09-17,Taberu,"taberu is a sleek interpolation of an izakaya, the traditional japanese pub, in the arts district, a few blocks east of little tokyo. although the address is on third street (the same address as yunomi handroll), the entrance is actually on traction avenue, between wurstküche and loqui. along the back wall is a long banquette with two-tops, while a massive refectory table sits in the front for shared dining. around 5:30 p.m. on a tuesday, there was only one other party of two; leaving around 7:00 p.m., there were maybe four parties total (one of which was that same party that was there when i arrived). the meal starts with a finger bowl to soak the little napkin pellet, and after a flashback to melissa mccarthy in ""spy,"" you're off to the races.the menu has a large selection of japanese and japanese-style craft beers, but the prices are high (as is common with imported japanese suds), so i decided to try one of their drinks based on shōchū, a neutral spirit that is generally around 25% abv and the japanese analog to soju. (they only have a beer-and-wine license, so no toki highballs here.) the ginger lemonade high was made with gari ginger, the pickled ginger served alongside sushi (an odd choice), and the advertised mint was nowhere to be found. the big wad of gari and ice took up a lot of real estate in the glass, and, for $9, it was rather disappointing, and i switched to draft sapporo after that.taberu lists its kushiyaki as ""yasai maki,"" translating to ""vegetable rolls"" -- even when there are no vegetables involved. servers come over with a large box of uncooked skewers for diners to peruse, like a yakitori version of a dessert cart. (between the dim lighting and forest of identification twigs, it's close to impossible to see anything in that box.) they have some unique varieties, although the most creative aren't necessarily the best. i made the mistake of cutting the chile relleno with the knife provided, and the ground pork chili filling oozed out everywhere; it was impossible to eat with chopsticks. it was tasty but a ridiculous mess. the shiso and gari rolled with pork belly was surprisingly bland, as was the bundle of green onions wrapped in pork belly. the tsukune (chicken meatballs) were tasty, but i would have preferred the traditional sweet soy glaze over shredded parmesan, and three smaller meatballs over the two large ones. my favorites were the more traditional skewers: yakitori, beef (""yakiniku""), and okra wrapped in pork belly, which is probably my favorite kushiyaki ever. the kushiyaki are served with a curry-like dry spice blend that is very tasty, though it can overwhelm the flavors.the gyōza are made in-house and probably the second-best examples in l.a. after the reigning champions about a mile south at afuri. they are unique in their shape, which resemble a taquito rather than the well-known crescent shape. i did miss the traditional tare sauce. (as with the skewers, they recommended i slather the gyōza in chili oil.) the karaage was also excellent, with five plump, flavorful pieces of dark meat in a powdery, tatsuta-age breading. i ended up taking most of the gyōza and karaage home, especially because i had to save room for the hōjicha pudding. hōjicha is green tea that is roasted in a pot over charcoal, and it has a nutty, toasty flavor. the japanese are master pudding makers, and this version, which is just slightly sweet, creamy, and slightly tannic, is delicious. as full as i was, i could've devoured a half-dozen of those tiny little puddings. it was the star of the meal, hands down.my experience at taberu wasn't perfect, but it was definitely positive. there are many things i did not get to sample that i want to try, and i'd like to go with others next time -- taberu definitely seems like it would be more fun with a group. i did feel like i was forgotten a few times at the back of the room, and some empty dishes lingered on the table a bit too long, but my server was very friendly. i would recommend having some regular napkins along with the magic tablet one: i thought that was simply for cleansing one's hands at the beginning, not to keep through the entire meal, so i ended up having to duck into the restroom for paper towels at one point. don't most places take the wet towel away after one use? but i digress. as little tokyo seems to have fewer and fewer good japanese dining options, it's good to see a place like taberu opening up nearby, and i think it holds promise as one of downtown's most promising japanese dining options.","806 E 3rd St Unit 140 Los Angeles, CA 90013",4.2,159,"Ramen, Izakaya",0.4666666666666668

211,2023-08-11,2023-09-17,Hollywood Thai,"we came in here tonight after doing a photoshoot nearby - we were a party of two young women. the restaurant had an overwhelmingly unpleasant 'fishy' smell as soon as we walked in, like spoiled seafood, and the vast majority of the restaurant was empty. we were seated immediately in a booth and brought water but it took awhile to get menus and drinks. the server was friendly but he never came back--- we were left on our own for so long without anyone coming by to see how we were doing. he told us to use the qr code for accurate pricing since the menus they gave us were not up to date (then why give them to us at all?). i ordered fried tofu and asked for a side of peanut sauce instead of sweet chili, and my friend ordered pad see ew and some mango sticky rice for dessert. our food took maybe 20 minutes to come out. the food was hot and fresh, the tofu perfectly crisp on the outside, but it was very mushy and soggy on the inside, like too much water was left in it maybe? and extremely bland, no flavor whatsoever. even when i dipped it in the peanut sauce that just tasted like peanut butter, no seasoning or heat in the sauce at all. it was like eating spongy cardboard with a mushy center. my friend said her food was good but honestly, we were astonished by the service. we sat down to eat at 9:15. we finished eating around 10 and waited for the server to come by to offer us to-go boxes and bring the check. we sat and talked, our plates obviously finished, no longer eating, until 10:40 when i finally flagged him over to bring us to-go boxes and the checks. he brought the to-go boxes and then vanished again. we boxed up our leftovers and waited, but no check arrived. at almost 11 he resurfaced and i flagged him down again and asked for the checks again. he said ""oh, no one brought them to you? sorry!"" and went to get the card machine and brought it to us. the food is a little pricey - my appetizer of fried tofu was $20 plus tip and the mandatory fee for using a debit card (we actually used apple pay) and while the portion size was generous i can't say the flavor or the service is going to make us come back. i know there's better food in thai town.","5241 Hollywood Blvd Los Angeles, CA 90027",3.8,671,Thai,0.19999999999999987
212,2023-09-16,2023-09-17,ixlb DimSum Eats- Hollywood,"the reason that ixlb dimsum eats - hollywood does not get five stars is because they absolutely refuse to alter anything in their menu - they even refuse to cut up the chinese sausage in the bento box, even though, technically, it is not any kind of substitution (i wanted to order the bento box for a person who could not eat large pieces of food, thus the request to cut up the chinese sausage). i even spoke to the manager, who absolutely refused. so, i ended up not placing a $65 order - their loss.compare this to any other chinese restaurant, most of which will customize their menus for the diner.we have not gone back to ixlb dimsum eats since the infamous ""chinese sausage"" incident. there is a really good upscale dim sum restaurant in studio city which has a much larger selection of dim sum and is an actual restaurant, as well as a section for counter service to-go orders (that restaurant is shanghai rose).it is a shame about the lack of flexibility at ixlb dimsum eats, because they have good dimsum, and i used to drive in from monterey park (to pick up large orders for several people) because i preferred ixlb dimsum eats' dimsum to dimsum from various restaurants in the san gabriel valley (which is saying something, because the sgv is known as a great area to get chinese food!)one thing that i loved is the turnip cake - it is very flavorful, but i suspect it might only be ordered by those people who are open to chinese food that is not ""americanized."" you can find turnip cakes in chinatown in authentic dimsum restaurants.ixlb dimsum eats is an upscale version of those authentic dimsum restaurants. the hargow and shrimp and chives dumplings are delicious. the sticky rice ball was disappointing: hard and with pieces of uncooked rice - we only ordered it once, and never again. instead, we would order the seafood pearl, which is similar, but the rice is sticky and soft. the curry puffs are good, but extremely greasy. the smiling fish bun is a take on bao, in an open-faced style. it is good! but if you want just the same fried fish without the bao and toppings, you can get the fried fish fillet which has 2 pieces of fish and a side of the same sauce that is in the smiling fish bun (the smiling fish bun only has 1 piece of fish).parking is horrendous around ixlb dimsum eats. there is a very small parking lot behind the restaurant (parallel to sunset) and very little street parking. there is an arby's nearby with a larger parking lot, but i don't know if they will tow away cars if they see people parking there and not going inside arby's. i would wait to go to ixlb dimsum eats until after 8pm just so i could find parking.in sum, the only reason i give ixlb dimsum eats only 3 stars is their lack of customer concern and lack of flexibility (it would have taken less than 2 minutes to cut up chinese sausage for the bento box ... ). other than a few bad items, most of the food is very good.","5900 Sunset Blvd Los Angeles, CA 90028",4.4,953,"Dim Sum, Hong Kong Style Cafe",0.6000000000000002

225,2022-10-06,2023-09-17,Phenakite,"phenakite has returned in a super stealth, under the radar multi course fashion inside of the forest from the trees art installation in east downtown los angeles.you are shocked when you refresh the phenakite tock for your daily check to see if they are back and serving and see actual reservations. you make one with no hesitation or care about the cost.the no-publicity approach seems to be destined to keep things on the dl. there appears to be a single seating for just five tables per night. it's all inclusive, food, tip and alcohol paid for when you make the reservation on tock.the evening begins with a non-alcoholic yuzu drink while you wait for a private time in the art installation. unusually everyone at your dinner has arrived early or on time (besides a party that no-showed, shockingly). which left some lag in the schedule as the art installation has some time padded in. you enjoy the cool air and the opening of the exhibit where a series of microphones have been cleverly changed into small speakersthat experience is great; and interesting, however the real magic begins when you slip into a gallery esque dining room. five tables all facing a kitchen where chef minh phan works with her team composing a multi course meal. you might say it's nine or ten courses but some of the courses include multiple small dishes so you wouldn't argue if the chef told you it was a 15- or 16-course meal.thematically the idea is tied to that of the art exhibit, indigenous foods (tho not religiously, like you might find at owamni - the sioux chef, in minneapolis), no waste, and the heartfelt imaginative cooking of the chef herself that is unlike any other in los angeles.her laptop sits nearby connected with an aux cable to a speaker. it keeps turning off as the laptop goes to sleep and the chef fiddles with it to restart her playlist of 90s and 00s indie rock and alternative. wilco and the magnetic fields serenade you.the walls are stark white with gallery lighting and a few branches screwed into them, but some have fallen. the wooden tables are decorated in a way that's elegant but also homey and reminiscent of how your mom or aunt might.and then the food. bold at every step. looking at past phenakite menus you see some of her themes, a blowtorch (which ties wonderfully to the art exhibit) lights filled mochi and a fig leaf on fire, creating smoke and ash that drifts over the table during the course.fauna of the forest with a flavor profile that is dreamlike. different stems and pieces that might be thrown away used and pickled.a series of small dishes including a three sisters dish, a crab cake with the perfect season of dill and tarragon, pickles from the sea to go with it. the lone dish of the night that fails to live up to its brothers and sisters is a shrimp with an elegant birds nest of root and tuber tempura fried on top of it. salty and beautiful but pales compared to the flavors of everything else you are served. perhaps that misses the point, and the salt is there to cleanse the palette.a fish dish with a medley of flavors and vegetables and perfectly splayed out fried mushrooms. the porridge course that one expects and loves from the beloved chef behind porridge + puffs. two remarkable bites of venison with bright seasoning and mouthing numbing qualities.a course called a dance party that again minimizes the waste from the kitchen. followed by a staple herbal granita and a crème desert.throughout the meal alcohol pairings were served. they match the food beautifully and you make note of new wineries to check out in santa barbara next time .the service is warm and enthusiastic. the servers when introducing themselves reveal that they are an art student and an actress. it's at once surprising, revealing and excusing. wines are poured occasionally with no explanation of the vintage and food dropped off without explanation, the menu is on the table so you can read, but the story is slightly lost in these moments. the lack of experience is at once endearing while also occasionally jarring given how remarkable the meal is.you embrace the at times awkward service with the same love and familiarity that the staff and space embrace you and embrace the strange situation they have found themselves in.from the entire time you felt purpose, warmth, and love poured into the meal you've been served. there isn't anything else quite like it, and you feel bad about wanting to tell people about it, as if it being secret could help it exist in its purity for a bit longer.and at the same time, you must talk and tell your friends about it, because you leave changed and touched in a way that few other meals ever accomplish.as you leave the gallery, you wave goodbye to the chef, and wish you could have this first experience all over again for the first time","1370 N St Andrews Pl Los Angeles, CA 90028",4.4,21,Diners,0.6000000000000002

(ones that are actually by the water where the oysters are 20 min old) it's also tiny inside, which i realize is simply the space they have to operate....but it feels cluttered and definitely affects the overall dining experience.overall, it's worth a visit if you like this kind of fare.","4880 Fountain Ave Los Angeles, CA 90029",4.4,320,Seafood,0.6000000000000002

227,2023-09-02,2023-09-17,Found Oyster,"i'd had a rough day today, and there's just nothing to lift my spirits like sitting at a bar with some raw oysters and a glass of wine. so i headed over to try found oyster on my way home, hoping for a lively but casual environment where i could just sit by myself at the bar and enjoy my surroundings.first of all, parking is a challenge before 7 p.m. (when restrictions are lifted on sunset) and if you're going to be there past 6 p.m., when neighborhood permit-only parking takes effect. timing-wise, it's probably best to arrive at found oyster when it opens at 4 and spend a couple of hours and then get your car out of there. after circling the surrounding blocks for about 20 minutes around 5:30 p.m. on a friday, i finally found an unrestricted spot about 0.2 miles away, but i was almost ready to give up.when i arrived, there were already people spilling out onto the sidewalk, waiting for tables. the restaurant has a bench and some chairs next to their outdoor seating that are dedicated specifically for people on the waitlist, and the nice thing is that someone will come out and take your wine order so you can get the party started before you're officially seated. i, however, got lucky and took the last seat at the end of the bar.when you first order, you check off boxes on a double-sided paper menu, kind of like you do in a sushi restaurant. remember to check the chalk board behind the bar to see the day's specials, including the oysters of the day.i ordered a dozen oysters, half and half of the two varieties -- but unfortunately it was so loud in there (the music was turned up way high, and the restaurant was full) that i couldn't quite hear which oysters were which when they arrived. they both tasted fresh and not too briney, and i really loved the cocktail sauce that came with it, which tasted house-made. (the mignonette was not my favorite, as i prefer more of a red wine vinegar style and less leafy green bits in it.) there's also some louisiana hot sauce bottles on the bar, if you like that sort of thing.to accompany my oysters i also ordered the bub & grandma's bread and butter appetizer. the bread was dense and grilled to a crisp -- i like really toasty toast so it was ok for me, but some might consider it overdone. it had been thoroughly oiled, so it actually didn't really need the soft salted butter splotch that had been added to the plate. being the butter fiend that i am, i ate it all anyway -- then again, others might think it's too much.i rounded out my meal with the wedge salad, which was a very generous portion. the bacon on top wasn't crispy, but more like lardons -- thick, cubed pieces of very dense, meaty bacon with a strong flavor. the stilton blue cheese was very good, but the dressing itself was more of a plain buttermilk and landed a little flat for me. i loved the tiny sliced tomatoes on top, they really added some farmers market freshness to the dish.i would normally have stayed longer and hung out, but it was so hot inside -- 92 degrees, as reported by one of the staffers. no one apologized for the heat, but i can only assume the a/c broke. it was legit windy in there with all the fans going (i had to put my hair in a pony for it not to blow into my food) but it was really uncomfortable still.also the wine is pretty expensive for a 4-ounce pour in small glasses, and there's no diet coke offered -- only mexican sprite. (i don't know if they have mexican coke, they told me they only had sprite.) and the bottle of tap water i was given when i sat down just wasn't cold enough to be refreshing. so i took off once i finished my food, which i was definitely full from.on the positive front, the food came out very quickly, and even when my server forgot to put in my wine order, it was remedied right away and they admitted their mistake. i felt so bad for everybody working there, suffering through the heat -- and i really admired how they weren't audibly complaining about it.","4880 Fountain Ave Los Angeles, CA 90029",4.4,320,Seafood,0.6000000000000002

240,2023-05-11,2023-09-17,Love Hour,this easily became my new favorite burger joint in the neighborhood. the potato bun was perfect and the pickles taste like they are made in house. the chicken nuggets remind me of mcdonald's but more flavorful and juicy. the fries were perfect! i love that you can add different flavors to the fries. their love sauce is so good! it's like a honey mustard style sauce. i wish they were open a little later but i do love that they have a little bar in the back. the served natural wine and beer. they were also playing the playoff nba games which is a nice perk. the bartender was super sweet and let me try different wines before i made my choice. all of the wines that i tasted were really good and it was hard to make a decision. i can totally see myself becoming a regular here! i'm so happy to stumble upon this place!,"532 S Western Ave Los Angeles, CA 90020",4.8,56,"Burgers, Food Stands, Bars",0.8666666666666666
